This was the first restaurant I visited in Italy. The food didn’t disappoint me. The food was authentic and delicious.
Gino&rsquo;s is located not far from the train station. It was the only quiet looking restaurant at the time and that&rsquo;s why I stopped in for a quick bite.
The bruschetta wasn&rsquo;t how I was expecting.">

<p>This was the first restaurant I visited in Italy. The food didn’t disappoint me. The food was authentic and delicious.</p>

<p>Gino&rsquo;s is located not far from the train station. It was the only quiet looking restaurant at the time and that&rsquo;s why I stopped in for a quick bite.</p>

<p>The bruschetta wasn&rsquo;t how I was expecting. I was expecting tomato chunks on top of the bread, but it came drizzled in olive oil with what seems like a pasta sauce on top. It was still good, just not what I was expecting.</p>

<p>The penne with eggplant also had olive oil all over it, with shredded mozzarella cheese on top. There was just the right amount of olive oil and cheese, and the eggplant was cooked just right.</p>

<p>The lasagna was nothing special, it came slapped on a plate, but did have crunchy corners.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t eat the bread they brought out, so I don&rsquo;t know if they charge for bread, but they did charge an 11% service fee and a soda was €3.90. The food was alright, service was alright, but total cost for food and service, wasn&rsquo;t worth it.</p>

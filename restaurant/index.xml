      <description>BBQ Garden
My friend invited us to her birthday at BBQ Garden this Saturday 6/22/2019. Met few new friends. Also table grilled BBQ was delicious.
It is buffet style BBQ. You can order as much as you can eat. There are many meat options but my favorite is still beef short ribs.
They also include sushi and Korean style side dishes. I like this restaurant. I would go back!
I made the cake for her and everyone likes my cake.</description>

This is a one star Michelin restaurant in Chicago. Went there with my work colleagues for lunch. We had 3-course pre-fixed menu lunch.
The color, presentation, and taste of each dish is so good. This is probably a best Mexican food I ever had!

      <description>Address: 22 E Golf Rd, Schaumburg, IL 60173 Modest strip-mall eatery offering heaping bowls of ramen noodles plus other Japanese dishes.
This place is a real hidden gem. TL&amp;rsquo;s Four Seasons is an excellent Chinese and Japanese restaurant. Their sushi is excellent too.
The staff is very polite and friendly. The food is very high quality, with very generous portions and reasonable prices.
Overall, I recommend this place to everyone.</description>

      <description>Gino’s, Venice Italy 2018-11-09 No Comments
Address: Rio Terà Lista di Spagna, 157, 30121 Venezia VE, Italy
This was the first restaurant I visited in Italy. The food didn’t disappoint me. The food was authentic and delicious.
Gino&amp;rsquo;s is located not far from the train station. It was the only quiet looking restaurant at the time and that&amp;rsquo;s why I stopped in for a quick bite.
The bruschetta wasn&amp;rsquo;t how I was expecting.</description>

      <description>BBQ Garden
My friend invited us to her birthday at BBQ Garden this Saturday 6/22/2019. Met few new friends. Also table grilled BBQ was delicious.
It is buffet style BBQ. You can order as much as you can eat. There are many meat options but my favorite is still beef short ribs.
They also include sushi and Korean style side dishes. I like this restaurant. I would go back!
I made the cake for her and everyone likes my cake.</description>

Actually, I did shopping at Friday and prepared food since Friday evening. I just let them to put chunked lamb on skewers. If I waited them to make food from scratch, it would take hours to finish.

          <p>Cooking with Cathy – episode 4.</p>

<p>Hosted this episode with friends before the summer end. It was a pleasant Saturday afternoon, we made charcoal grilled kebab together.</p>

<p>Actually, I did shopping at Friday and prepared food since Friday evening. I just let them to put chunked lamb on skewers. If I waited them to make food from scratch, it would take hours to finish.</p>

<p>Cooking with Cathy is just for fun. I don’t mind to get all ingredients ready and we assemble the food together.
We were making lamb kebabs together.
First course was iceberg lettuce salad with ranch dressing.
The weather was perfect for dinning at my backyard.
Garlic bread is a great combo with kebab.
Salmon kebab
Lamb kebab
We all wore the same aprons.</p>

<p>After kebab dinner, outside became dark. We moved inside and played games together.</p>

<p>I also prepared a new Taiwan style dessert. The name is MeetFresh. There are stores in LA, Chicago Chinatown, and San Francisco etc. I ate once in LA so I learned the recipe online and made this for the party.</p>

<p>Xiaoxi also bought a chestnut cake. It is French style cake and made by a Japanese bakery store.</p>

<p>Day Hike: Path of the Glacier &amp; Cavell Meadows Trails</p>

<p>Duration: 3 hours round-trip</p>

<p>Difficulty: Moderate-difficult</p>

<p>Start/Finish: Cavell Meadows parking lot</p>

<p>Elevation change: 1300feet</p>

<p>Angelic glaciers and heavenly scenery give this recently restored mountain trail a distinctly ethereal quality.</p>

<p>With its wings spread celestially between Mt Edith Cavell and Sorrow Peak, Angel Glacier gives the appearance of hovering over a small sapphire lake that is afloat with icebergs. The lake’s ice-blue sheen is made all the more dramatic for the barren, stony surroundings that were created by the glacier’s not-so-long-ago flight across the valley.</p>

<p>The Path of the Glacier Loop is the most popular hike in the area, but, for greater solitude and a brilliant wildflower display (in July), head further up the peak to Cavell Meadows.</p>

<p>To reach the trailhead from Jasper, follow Hwy 93A south to Cavell Rd and then drive 7.4 miles to a parking lot. Interpretive signs along the route tell the story of both Edith Cavell and the glacier.</p>

<p>Beginning with a climb through rocky moraine you’ll pass the Cavell Meadows Trail turnoff after 0.3 miles. The Path of the Glacier Trail continues ascending another 0.6 miles to a fantastic viewpoint of Angel Glacier, reflected in tiny Cavell Pond. Although the trail descends to the water, approaching the famous ice caves here is extremely hazardous. Keep your distance from the caves and beware of falling ice.</p>

<p>From the lake, the path levels out and loops back to the parking lot. This are was covered by the glacier until the 1950s, and small trees and plants are only just beginning to reappear.</p>

<p>A loop around Cavell Meadows will treat you to fantastic views and an even better workout. Take the left turn off the Path of the Glacier Trail at 0.3 miles and begin a steep ascent north. The trail soon levels off with clear views of the glacier to the right. This area is strewn with boulders up to 13ft high, left behind by the glacier. After crossing a stream, switchbacks take you north into the forest; keep right at the junction 1.4 miles – crossing two more streams before entering an open, flowery meadow. At 1.9 miles a side trail branches right to the Lower Viewpoint.</p>

<p>Returning to the main trail, a brief climb brings you to another juction. If you’ve had enough, head left to meet up with the path of the Glacier Trail; if you’ve still got some energy and a penchant for climbs, turn right for the Upper Viewpoint.</p>

<p>The way is steep, and the rockstrewn trail becomes fainter and slippery. Continuing uphill to the right brings you to a high sub-alpine meadow with an explosion of flowers. The path runs along a bank of loose shale with a steep drop on the left; then it turns right, where it becomes incredibly steep and rather treacherous.</p>

<p>You’ll know you’ve reached the Upper Viewpoint by the yellow marker; the views are also something of a giveaway. Southwest is Mt Edith Cavell; Pyramid Mountain lies to the north and Roche Bonhomme to the northeast. Angel Glacier is suspended to the west; from this height you have an impressive view of its wings and upper half.</p>

<p>Heading back, the descent along the loose shale is tricky. At the juction, turn right to return through lush meadows to the Path of the Glacier Trail.</p>

<p>Icefileds Parkway Scenic Drive</p>

<p>Duration: 2 hours</p>

<p>Distance: 103km</p>

<p>From Jasper to Columbia Icefield Center</p>

<p>Considered one of the most scenic drives in North America, the Icefields Pkwy is a melange of cassading waterfalls and spectacularly carved peaks, whose crowning glory is the glistening Columbia Icefield on the park’s southern limits.</p>

<p>It measures 230km from Jasper Town down to Lake Louise; a 108km segment of the route traverses Jasper NP, incorporating some of the region’s start attractions.</p>

<p>Driving south out of Jasper, the first hightlight is Mt Edith Cavell, the town’s snowcapped guardian, accessible via a winding spur road off Hwy 93A. Stop here to stroll through flower-filled meadows and catch a glimpse of the peak’s wing-shaped Angel Glacier. Rejoin the main parkway for 20km and you’ll pass Horseshoe Lake, with its steep-sided cliffs and clear, bracing waters, followed quickly by the Athabasca Falls, the park’s most voluminous waterfall, which throws its glacial meltwater over a 21m limestone cliff.</p>

<p>Look out for wildlife on the next section of the route as you head south through a wide corridor of mountains that parallels the Continental Divide. At Honeymoon Lake there’s a viewpoint over the Athabasca River, while 2km further on, at Sunwapta Falls, you can refuel at the restaurant or stretch your legs on the short hike to the waterfall. This is also the start of a wilderness hike to Fortress Lake.</p>

<p>As the tree cover thins and the river becomes a confusing maze of different channels, you’ll start to notice the glaciers. Stop at the Stutfield Glacier Viewpoint, jsut pass Beauty Creek, to admire this outlying tentacle of the Columbia Icefield; 2km further on your’ll pass Tangle Falls and the start of the scenic Wilcox Pass Trail. The drive’s apex is the green-roofed Columbia Icefield Center and the world-famours Athabasca Glacier. Stop here for interpretive displays, a walk around the Forefield Trail and an excursion on one of the unique Snocoaches or to the new Glacier Skywalk.</p>

<p>Jasper National Park seems like the perfect antidote 解毒药. Who needs a shrink when you’ve got Maligne Lake? What use is Facebook when you’re two days by foot? And, how can you possibly describe the Athabasca Glacier in a 140-character tweet? Filled with the kind of immense scenery that has turned the monosyllabic into romantic poets, Jasper is a rugged beauty; more raw and less tourist-pampering than its southern cousin Banff, and hence host to a more ambitious, adventurous visitor. You’ve a better chance of seeing more wildlife and fewer people.</p>

<p>Bald Hills Loop</p>

<p>Duration: 4 – 6 hours</p>

<p>Distance: 6.5 miles</p>

<p>Difficulty: Difficult</p>

<p>Start/Finish: Maligne Lake parking lot</p>

<p>Elevation Change: 1640ft</p>

<p>Get above the treeline on the north shore of Maligne Lake with this steep but worthwhile climb to a bald 360-degree viewpoint.</p>

<p>The road from Jasper dead-ends on the north shore of Maligne Lake, which is home to a chalet, restaurant, boat dock and parking lot. A handful of hikes converge here, all of them well signposted. Teh Bald Hills trail starts near the parking lot at the northwest corner of the lake on a wide fire road that leads steadily uphill – get used to it; ‘uphill’ is the central theme of the hike. The more altitude you gain, the more the trees diminish in both density and stature. After 2 miles, the trail splits. The easier fire road continues following a gradual and circuitous ascent, while a rougher, much steeper trail takes a more direct path. Opting for the steeper route will save you 0.9 miles in distance, but cost a lot more sweat. The paths converge again on the upper cusp of the treeline at the top of the old fire road close to the site of a demolished fire lookout tower.</p>

<p>Here, the trail flattens out momentarily, traversing the mountain at the top of the tree line, before reaching another path juction. This is the start of the Bald Hills summit loop. Branch right here and a steep, clearly visible path takes you up a treeless slope to the rocky summit. Some hikers rest here before descending the way they came, but, for the sake of some more fantastic views, it’s worth carrying on. Weather permitting, the full loop is clearly visible from the summit. First you trace down to an astounding viewpoint over the uninhabited Evelyn Creek Valley. From here the path briefly climbs a rocky ridge, before descending and looping through alpine meadows back to the trai junction just below the summit. From here you can retrace your steps to Maligne Lake.</p>

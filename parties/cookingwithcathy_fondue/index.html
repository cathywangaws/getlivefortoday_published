Still can’t get together with other friends yet since we all are busy here and there. However our next party will be fondue party. I did some research about food.
4/28/2019 seems another winterstorm day. I was planning out of town but the weather forecast freaked me out. It is better to stay at home to worry free about flights. So I contacted my friends right after work at Friday to gather people together for the Fondue Party.">

<p>Still can’t get together with other friends yet since we all are busy here and there. However our next party will be fondue party. I did some research about food.</p>

<p>4/28/2019 seems another winterstorm day. I was planning out of town but the weather forecast freaked me out. It is better to stay at home to worry free about flights. So I contacted my friends right after work at Friday to gather people together for the Fondue Party.</p>

<p>I decided to have 3 different fondues, just like how a restaurant does to make them for fun. I did some research a few weeks ago. I prefer to make them easy but good looking. Presentation is always important for me. I like eating by eyes to feel first and then by mouth to taste.
Heavy snow outside and hot fondue inside
Cheese fondue:</p>

<p>Small pickle, baby carrot, sliced apple, broccoli, pretzel, French baguette, ham, green olives.</p>

<p>Ingredients: 24 ounces Kaukauna Cheese Spread Cups and 12 ounces beer.
Chicken Broth fondue:</p>

<p>Beef steak, shrimps, broccoli, firm tofu, fish balls with dipping sauce.
Dipping sauce
Chocolate fondue:</p>

<p>Banana, strawberry, marshmallow, pineapple for dipping, cookies, red apple.</p>

<p>Fondue: bitter chocolate, milk, heavy whipping cream.</p>

<p>Once you peel and cut bananas, they will start turning brown. The air starts affecting their color immediately, even if it takes a while for you to notice the change in color. One way to stop that is to dip or brush the banana slices in lemon or lime juice. Pineapple or other acidic fruits also work.
Port dessert wine with chocolate fondue
We also played some card games together</p>

<p>It was a great party. Before hosted this party, I wasn’t sure if everyone would like fondue or not. After eating them, we all seemed like them very much because we almost finished everything I prepared. Happy to spend some time with friends at a snowy Saturday evening.
Cheese needs to be threaded first. The fondue pot needs to add smashed garlic and white wine to boil and then add cheese in to mix them often.</p>

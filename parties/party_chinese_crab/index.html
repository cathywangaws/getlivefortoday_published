I am terrified of nightclubs. I hate loud bars. And I get lost at concerts. This makes Friday and Saturday nights as a non-80 something difficult.
As soon as it was socially age appropriate, I began to shift people from raves and bar crawls into game nights and dinner parties.
My first dinner party was a quasi-disaster. There were a ton of appetizers and dessert, but not enough real food.">

<p>I am terrified of nightclubs. I hate loud bars. And I get lost at concerts. This makes Friday and Saturday nights as a non-80 something difficult.</p>

<p>As soon as it was socially age appropriate, I began to shift people from raves and bar crawls into game nights and dinner parties.</p>

<p>My first dinner party was a quasi-disaster. There were a ton of appetizers and dessert, but not enough real food. People came really late and left early. My groups of friends did not mix well. And I ran around like a crazy person.</p>

<p>HOWEVER, there was a hint of goodness. I saw potential in the night and a few of my friends asked when I was going to do it again. BINGO! If even one person is into something you are doing, then you have something special.</p>

<p>It was time for an informal people experiment. I was going to run a number of different parties all with different variables. Test the outcomes, feel the vibe and learn how to throw the perfect dinner party.</p>

<p>There are some counter-intuitive things I discovered and some seemingly unimportant details that make all the difference.</p>

<p>One of my friends is changing his job so he wanted to give us a treat. We always prefer to eat at a home instead of a restaurant because we feel eating at a home is more relaxing. So he bought a box of king crab legs and two boxes of marinated salmons from Costco. I offered to prepare the food for them. It is party time! Let’s have fun!</p>

      <description>This party was finally over and got relief now. Hosting a party for soccer team is stressful than others because they are Andy’s friends. We made food plan together and started to prepare it couple of days earlier in order to make sure the party would be successful.
Bought a box of frozen crab legs from Costco. We decided to serve them a seafood theme dinner.
Appetizers: fried tofu &amp;amp; wonton</description>

It is one of Andy’s best friend’s 50th birthday so I hosted a party with a small group for him at my home. I also make a special birthday cake for him and let his wife to write sth on the cake. I also invited another couple who have similar life style like us.
It is also Eastern Weekend so bought fresh flowers for the holiday.                               </description>

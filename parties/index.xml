Protected: Rainbow Dumpling 2019-03-29
I grouped few people together who have same interest about cooking. Rainbow dumpling is our first episode of Cooking with Cathy! They brought dumpling fillings and I prepared doughs. We made wraps and dumplings together. That was fun time with friends.
I got the idea from Pinterest app. We are not only making food but for fun!

Still can’t get together with other friends yet since we all are busy here and there. However our next party will be fondue party. I did some research about food.
4/28/2019 seems another winterstorm day. I was planning out of town but the weather forecast freaked me out. It is better to stay at home to worry free about flights. So I contacted my friends right after work at Friday to gather people together for the Fondue Party.</description>

      <description>Cooking with Cathy – episode 3.
Today is also the last day for Game of Thrones. We are all fan of it so I got together to cook first and then watch the finale together at my basement.
The ending of Game of Thrones made people upset. However, I think that is what it is. No matter what kind of ending is, people will always not satisfied. For me, I think, the story is not ending yet.</description>

      <description>Cooking with Cathy – episode 4.
Hosted this episode with friends before the summer end. It was a pleasant Saturday afternoon, we made charcoal grilled kebab together.
Actually, I did shopping at Friday and prepared food since Friday evening. I just let them to put chunked lamb on skewers. If I waited them to make food from scratch, it would take hours to finish.
Cooking with Cathy is just for fun.</description>

      <description>This party was finally over and got relief now. Hosting a party for soccer team is stressful than others because they are Andy’s friends. We made food plan together and started to prepare it couple of days earlier in order to make sure the party would be successful.
Bought a box of frozen crab legs from Costco. We decided to serve them a seafood theme dinner.
Appetizers: fried tofu &amp;amp; wonton</description>

      <description>Gourmet Chinese Food
One of my friends is really good at cooking Chinese food. It is not only delicious but beautiful presentation! They are much better than restaurant food.
She spent lot of time to prepare them from scratch. We always eat more than we could.
This is seafood soup which I like it very much.
The crispy basil is so impressive.
Japanese rice wine from Costco. This tea set cost RMB 5000 because they made with pure gold and silver!</description>

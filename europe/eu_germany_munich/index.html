Munich was my last destination during this vacation. I didn’t have any plans for this city. I decided to just relax and had a walk in the old town. We arrived there at about sunset time but still many people in this area. Many shopping stores were decorated with bright and sparkling lights.
First, we returned the car at the rental place. All rental car companies share the same return location so it is very crowded and you need to wait Hertz people to find you.">

<p>Munich was my last destination during this vacation. I didn’t have any plans for this city. I decided to just relax and had a walk in the old town. We arrived there at about sunset time but still many people in this area. Many shopping stores were decorated with bright and sparkling lights.</p>

<p>First, we returned the car at the rental place. All rental car companies share the same return location so it is very crowded and you need to wait Hertz people to find you.</p>

<p>Also shuttle bus to hotels are not free in MUC airport. After we checked in the hotel and took a rest, we took the subway to the city that is about 1 hour from the airport.</p>

<p>The market in the old city was closing.</p>

<p>I was in the old city hall area few years ago. It is still same without change.</p>

<p>People like sit outside to talk and have meal together even though it is chilly outside.</p>

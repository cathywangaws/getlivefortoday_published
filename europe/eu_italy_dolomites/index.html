          <p>God’s Back Garden – the Dolomites, Italy</p>

<p>The Dolomites in the North of Italy boast some of the mightiest granite peaks of Europe. This region is home to a spectacular road that provides both exhilarating and scenic driving.</p>

<p>The breathtaking region around the Dolomites of Italy is one of the most beautiful places on earth. We visited it in October which the fall color was changing that made our road trip more romantic.</p>

<p>The picturesque countryside is full of rugged mountains, scenic hikes, beautiful lakes with brilliant turquoise waters, and charming, tiny villages straight out of a fairytale.</p>

<p>The mountainous trail boasts a charming contrast between scenic valleys and dramatic vertical peaks, each presenting its own array of natural beauty.</p>

<p>Hiking in autumn in the Dolomites is otherworldly. The larch tree needles turn golden yellow, the air is crisp and fresh, and there are fewer tourists to share the trail with!</p>

<p>Walk peaceful paths through ancient villages and imagine life here in the past and its intersection with the present…</p>

<p>Most importantly, we enjoyed ourselves! The Dolomites is arguably one of the most beautiful and captivating places on Earth. The weather was awesome during our visiting in the Dolomites. Local people were so friendly to us. Breathtaking trails elevated our spirits. Small villages allowed us to take a step back in time and experienced the simpler things in life. There are sights here that no camera can capture, so we took our time and took it all in. This trip in year 2018 left us with memories to last a lifetime!</p>

<p><strong>The North of Italy - Driving the Dolomites, Italy</strong></p>

<p>First, we stopped at a visitor center at Longarone, 32013 Province of Belluno, Italy. The visitor center has nobody except one guy sit behind the counter. He gave us very good information about Dolomites area and he told us we were lucky since the weather in Dolomites was great this week. Usually, mountain areas have lot of rain and cloudy sky!</p>

<p>The Dolomites in the North of Italy have some of the granite peaks of Europe. This region is home to a spectacular road that provides both exhilarating and scenic driving. The Great Dolomites Road takes you from Bolzano to Cortina d’Ampezzo through the heart of the UNESCO-listed Dolomites.</p>

<p>As soon as we entered Dolomites area, the views start dramatically changed.</p>

<p>The milky color lake is so calm. I just wanted to sit here to enjoy the beautiful scenery.</p>

<p>When I saw the clothes are outside, I guess they probably don’t have drier to dry out their clothes and use natural lights. So there are still some countries don’t have everything like America has!</p>

<p>I don’t even know the name of this village. It is so quiet and barely to see people on the street.</p>

<p>I can tell this is a romantic village. People live here must enjoy their life so much. What a lovely pink bike!</p>

<p>A nature jewelry.</p>

<p>I can’t stop running. I can’t stop deep breathe. The mountains, clouds, and air are so fresh so open to me. I had to open my arms to hug them!</p>

<p>When was my last time to have swing? This is fun! I wish I never grow up!</p>

<p>A mild day with 70ish degree. Driving on the Dolomites! There are so many places I wanted to stop to take a picture. I really wanted to capture every moment in Dolomites.</p>

<p>Cortina d’Ampezzo, Province of Belluno, Italy.</p>

<p>I will come back here for hiking! I want to get closer to the granite mountains…</p>

<p>Italy is a famous country on the world. There are Rome, Venice, Milan, etc but I still like open landscapes in Northern Italy!</p>

<p>Coffee break at TRE CIME that is just across the lake. In Europe, most people drink espresso, cappuccino, or latte with small cups, not like America with big cups. European coffee is not very bitter. It tastes strong but with sweetness and aroma.</p>

<p>Lago di Dobbiaco, Province of Bolzano – South Tyrol</p>

<p>This is the landscape I was looking to see. It didn’t disappoint me at all!</p>

<p>Brunico-Bruneck, is the beating heart of the Pustertal Valley and a vibrant town with vibrant people. In 2009 it was named the best small town in Italy to live in.</p>

<p>Brunico-Bruneck combines wonderful characteristics of the region.</p>

<p>This museum (Bruneck Castle) will open at 10am and I was there in the early morning so I just took this picture at outside of the gate.</p>

<p>The view from the hill.</p>

<p>I went through one of the impressive town gates and I found myself in the midst of a lively town.</p>

<p>Church is everywhere in Northern Italy.</p>

<p>This ruined castle is just next to the highway.</p>

<p>What kind of life is for people live here?</p>

<p>This area has many vineyards as well.</p>

<p>Hello, happy cows!</p>

<p>We started hiking from here. This was the highlight of my trip in Dolometies, Italy.</p>

<p>These apples look so fresh. I really wanted to taste one but I didn’t.</p>

<p>What a quiet hiking trail. This is what I like most.</p>

<p>Take a break on a bench. The village is just behind me.</p>

<p>Sit on the soft grass and breath the fresh air.</p>

<p>This small road is shared with residence vehicles.</p>

<p>As we climbed up attractive mountain landscapes open up to us and the unique saw-tooth peaks appear. The ‘Grande strada delle Dolomiti’ encompasses the iconic grey peaks and plateaus but also forested hills and green valleys. The combination of these two colors create a spectacular contrasts. From the 2239 meters peak The Great Dolomites Road snakes down along a magnificent valley that includes a lake (Lago di Carezza), a castle (Andraz castle) and a cable car that provides excellent views of the surrounding nature.</p>

<p>多洛米蒂山Dolomites, 是很多驴友喜欢造访的意大利名山，此地足以媲美加拿大班芙，可惜这次只安排了两天时间，期待下次补上错过的多处小镇、山谷及Hiking trails…..
1. 经过Belluno 和Auronzo di Casore，经过九曲十八湾，到达Lake Misurina/密苏里纳湖，从这可远眺拉瓦雷多山三峰山/Tre Cime di Lavaredo，附近多处hiking trails
2. 经过Brunico Bruneck, 到达Castelrotto Kastelruth小镇，徒步上山
3. Chiusa Klausen小镇，徒步上山</p>

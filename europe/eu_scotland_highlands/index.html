Scotland is one of the most beautiful natural countries around the world. The Scottish Highlands are the home of mountains, glens, and rivers. It is no wonder why they appear as locations in so many movies or TV shows, like Mel Gibson’s self-directed film “Brave Heart”, James Bond’s Skye Fall in “007” movie, “Harry Potter” etc.
There are quite a few ways to get the Highlands, either by train, bus, or car.">

          <p>Dip into the regions – Highlands, Scotland</p>

<p>Scotland is one of the most beautiful natural countries around the world. The Scottish Highlands are the home of mountains, glens, and rivers. It is no wonder why they appear as locations in so many movies or TV shows, like Mel Gibson’s self-directed film “Brave Heart”, James Bond’s Skye Fall in “007” movie, “Harry Potter” etc.</p>

<p>There are quite a few ways to get the Highlands, either by train, bus, or car. Scotland is left-hand side driving so we didn’t rent a car. We opted for an organized tour that started and ended at Edinburgh. The big bus was full with all tourists. I got a window seat that gave me a better view of this beautiful land.
The gorgeous valley – Glencoe</p>

<p>A glen is another word for a narrow valley and the Highlands is filled with them. The most popular glen is Glencoe. The valley is consistently complimented by both travelers and locals for its inspiring landscape, with many recent visitors describing its terrain as “out of this world.”</p>

<p>Picturesque ruins – Urguhart Castle</p>

<p><img src="/image/Europe/Scotland/Scotland06.jpg" alt="Highlands, Scotland" title="Dip into the regions – Highlands, Scotland" /></p>

<p>The castle is located on the banks of Loch Ness with 1,000 years of history. It has a distinctly Highland heritage. We glimpsed of medieval life and enjoyed stunning views.</p>

<p>A famous place to visit – Loch Ness</p>

<p>Loch Ness is an icon of Scotland. It just seems like a place that should be visited. Legend has it that this lake is home to Nessie, the Loch Ness monster. People travel all over the world to visit this famous loch, hoping to get a chance to spot the underwater monster. The water of Loch Ness are dark, no wonder it will cause so much speculation.</p>

<p>It was a sunny and mild day. The light was constantly changing and playing across a vast natural canvas. Therefore, I got the great opportunities to capture the wonderful photographic moments in time.</p>

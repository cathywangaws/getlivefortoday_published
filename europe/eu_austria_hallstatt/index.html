          <p>Hallstatt is an umber-picturesque town in Austria. Surrounded by the massive Dachstein mountains, this town is a visual treat to the sore eyes. It features on the list of most romantic towns in Europe.</p>

<p>Being a travel geek, I had seen numerous pictures of Hallstatt and had a mental note of visiting this fascinating town someday. This town was on our way to Croatia so we decided to stay there for one night during our European road trip in year 2018. As we drove closer to this region, we could catch glimpses of the lake and the majestic mountains from the winding roads. It felt as thought the mountains were narrowing closer towards us and I was brimming with excitement at this sight.</p>

<p>When reaching the village, it was sundown time. We walked around the charming town. The village itself is a magnificent place with wooden houses and small shops and restaurants in the backdrop of the lake and mountains partially covered with clouds are just stunning . It is just like if it’s out of a fairytale book!</p>

<p>We walked closer to the lake along the boardwalk which seemed to be inundated with a lot of happy tourists. I was curious to know if there was some good photo opportunity that I was missing. As we walked closer I realized that it was this family of swans that was holding the attention of all the tourists. Needless to say everyone was busy taking pictures and selfies.</p>

<p>Once I saw the old town with its towering church spire, I enthusiastically pointed out to Andy, “That is the place that is featured in all postcards”. We decided to come back before sunrise next day. We wanted to avoid crowds and peacefully enjoy a quiet moment in this postcard town!</p>

<p>Next early morning, there were some photographers who had setup their cameras and quietly waited for the sunrise. Andy and I joined the group and took a shot every few minutes because the color was changing dramatically when the sun goes up.</p>

<p>The gem-colored lake light reflects the colorful houses, and it is like a fairyland!</p>

<p>After sunrise, we stopped by at Hallstatt market. The wealth of the village is easily reflected in its colorful alpine houses with their flower boxes hanging from their windows and balconies.</p>

<p>The town has only about a 1000 inhabitants. Hallstatt has the oldest salt mine in the world. “Hall” actually means salt in celtic. With its old world charm and unique scenic location it attracts a lot of day trippers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Life needs to wait, waiting for a gust of wind, waiting for a flower to bloom, or waiting for this dusk… LIFE IS A DREAM, MAKE IT REAL!</p>

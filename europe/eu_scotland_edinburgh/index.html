          <p>BAREFOOT ADVENTURE – Edinburgh, Scotland</p>

<p>Scotland is an interesting and exciting place to visit. We took a direct flight from Chicago to EDI (Edinburgh International Airport) for my barefoot adventure in July, 2018.</p>

<p><img src="/image/Europe/Scotland/Edinburgh01.jpeg" alt="Edinburgh, Scotland" title="BAREFOOT ADVENTURE – Edinburgh, Scotland" /></p>

<p>Edinburgh is Scotland’s capital and is not a big city like London and most of attractions are in the medieval old town area, so they are all walking distance. The most interested place is Edinburgh Castle and Royal Miles for us. We are not really interested in whiskey experience this time because we just had whiskey tour in Memphis, Tennessee in our last trip.</p>

<p><img src="/image/Europe/Scotland/Edinburgh02.jpeg" alt="Edinburgh, Scotland" title="BAREFOOT ADVENTURE – Edinburgh, Scotland" /></p>

<p>We booked the Double Tree Hotel near by the EDI airport. We arrived in the early morning and the receptionist allowed us for early check-in that surprised us and a welcome treat was waiting for us in our room – a bottle of red wine, a bottle of local craft beer, with a set of chocolates that surprised us again. Scotland gave us a great impression at the beginning! We like this country!</p>

<p><img src="/image/Europe/Scotland/Edinburgh03.jpeg" alt="Edinburgh, Scotland" title="BAREFOOT ADVENTURE – Edinburgh, Scotland" /></p>

<p>We took the Airlink 100 bus from outside the Double Tree hotel to the Waverly station which is the last stop of this public bus. It took about 30 minutes to the center of the city. Then we needed to walk about 10 minutes to uphill to the castle gate. As soon as I got off the bus, the scenery attracted us so much. It is a charming city, people around you, mild sunny day, and beautiful architectures! I am ready to see and experiences this charming Scotland’s city with my barefoot!</p>

<p>Immersed ourselves in the history of Edinburgh Castle</p>

<p>This castle is suited on Castle Rock in the city of Edinburgh, Scotland. Castle Rock formed after a volcano erupted over 340 million years ago. Castle Rock had been a military base and royal residence for centuries. The castle was under siege.</p>

<p>From the late 18th century to the early 19th, Edinburgh Castle was used to hold military prisoners from England’s many wars. The castle became a national monument in 1814 after a mass prison break proved that the castle could not hold prisoners. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the castle was slowly restored. Military ceremonies began to be held there and, in 1927, part of the castle was turned into the Scottish National War Memorial.</p>

<p>Edinburgh Castle is now one of the most popular tourist attractions in Scotland. More than one million people who visit the castle each year. You can witness military ceremonies, historical re-enactments, and visit sites such as St. Margaret’s Chapel and the Great Hall of King James IV in the castle.
Quick Wander on the Royal Mile</p>

<p>The Royal Mile is part of the medieval town. It connects Edinburgh Castle with the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Despite being crammed with tourists, it’s one of Europe’s best sightseeing walks. There are many small shops and they sale all kinds of souvenirs, cashmere scarfs, kilts, whiskey, and more. Each shop decorated with fresh flowers outside of windows. You even can talk in Chinese with sales ladies. It must have lot of Chinese visitors here and they must like Scottish scarfs. I shopped a little bit but I wasn’t sure about the quality and price. So I didn’t buy anything at the end. I just enjoyed the sightseeing on this road!</p>

<p>The Royal Mile connects between the castle and the palace. There are varieties when you stroll on this street, from historic buildings, shops, statues, to pubs, restaurants.

You can see a piper plays bagpipe by wearing the custom kilt. If you like his play, you can donate some coins.</p>

<p><img src="/image/Europe/Scotland/Edinburgh11.jpeg" alt="Edinburgh, Scotland" title="BAREFOOT ADVENTURE – Edinburgh, Scotland" /></p>

<p>In the Royal Mile, you can’t miss the St Giles’ Cathedral. The church in Scotland is a brown brick. With a castle feel, but not as rough as Irish grey stones.
A Glimpse of the “Close” (passageways)</p>

<p><img src="/image/Europe/Scotland/Edinburgh12.jpeg" alt="Edinburgh, Scotland" title="BAREFOOT ADVENTURE – Edinburgh, Scotland" />

<p>The small alleyways are called Close or Court etc. They were usually named after a memorable occupant of one of the apartments. A close is private property, hence gated and closed to the public sometimes. It is narrow but it is wide enough for a horse and cart to go through a close. A close is between two tall buildings. This gives a canyon-like appearance and atmosphere.</p>

<p>Harry Potter Books at The Elephant House</p>

<p>Inspired a coffee house by the movie of Harry Potter. I have never watched this movie yet so I am not fan of it. Since it is close to the Royal Mile, we walked down over there and had a quick peek. Inside was full with young people and it just looked like other normal coffee shop for me. The writer of Harry Potter, J. K. Rowling, spent time writing her novels in the back rooms of the cafe. From this café, she could see the Castle, Greyfriars Kirkyard and many other places which gave her inspiration for lots of locations in the books.</p>

<p>Taste Scotland National Dish – Haggis</p>

<p>Love it or hate it – Haggis is Scotland’s national dish. Haggis is a savory pudding containing sheep’s pluck; minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, traditionally encased in the animal’s stomach though now often in an artificial casing instead.</p>

<p>It sounds very strange to me but I still want to give it a try. I always like to do a life time experience. The dish presentation looks nice. When I had my first bite of haggis, the flavor is unique. I could taste the spice. The texture is chewy. I just had few bites and then I stopped. I wouldn’t order it again. I just experienced it!</p>

<p>Edinburgh is an amazing city, full of life, cobbled streets, inviting pubs, and beautiful architecture. We adore Gothic style buildings, so it’s no surprise I found Edinburgh so incredibly breathtaking.</p>

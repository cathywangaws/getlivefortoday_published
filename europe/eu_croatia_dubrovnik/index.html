<p>Game of Thrones is likely one of the most talked about TV shows of the decade and Dubrovnik, Croatia has been a renowned Game of Thrones filming location. After all Dubrovnik is King’s Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms!
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik02.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>Dubrovnik’s architecture, City Walls, its open and narrow streets made of big stone blocks helped Dubrovnik to change personality quickly. That’s why Dubrovnik has become one of the most famous filming locations of the Game of Thrones.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik03.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>The filming crew was shocked when they came to Dubrovnik and saw it for the first time. So did we! It looked the same as King’s Landing we had in our minds. We were absolutely in love with this place. Food, people, and culture left us breathless.</p>

<p>So the best way to get involved with the fantasy world of Game of Thrones is to travel to the filming destinations. We took two weeks vacation at year 2018 and made a road trip from Frankfurt, Germany, to Dubrovnik, Croatia, even though we visited other countries/cities. Dubrovnik was our destination and was our mission to seek as many Game of Thrones filming locations we could find in there. We stayed outside of the old city but there was a beautiful night view from our balcony down to the city and the sea.

<p><strong>Walk of Shame / Jesuit Stairs</strong>
Here was the scene when Cersei had to walk naked in the streets of King’s Landing from the Great Sept of Baelor to the Red Keep. It is probably one of the most famous scenes in the whole Game of Thrones series. All the time, an annoying woman was ringing a bell in her ear, saying shame. Here, the first scene, where Cersei is standing on the top of the stairs, took place.

<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik06.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>This is one of the most popular Games of Thrones locations in Dubrovnik. Every day fans take thousands of photos on this location. For filming this scene, HBO paid a large amount because there is a lot of restaurants and coffee bars in this street. They had to close for the whole day during the filming. That’s why this is one of the most expensive scenes in the entire Game of Thrones shooting in Dubrovnik.

<p><strong>Pile Gate Entrance to Old Town</strong></p>

<p>Pile Gate is the main entrance to Dubrovnik’s Old Town. All Pilecorners have been used as settings during second and third season of Game of Thrones. Most in Season 2, Episode 6 ‘The Old Gods and the New’ in the scene “The Riot” when King Joffrey returns to Red Keep after Marcella went to Dorne and he gets attacked by angry mobs gathered at the entrance. He screams, ‘Kill him, kill them all’ after someone throws manure at his face.

<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik10.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>Making this particular scene the film team locked the gate and filmed for approximately 20 minutes. It caused impatience and tourist were yelling outside to get in.</p>

<p><strong>Pile Bay / West Harbor</strong></p>

<p>In the Game of Thrones Season 3 Episode 1 – Valar Dohaeris, Sansa Stark and Shae is sitting by the docks talking about ships and the places they’re headed. Baelish arrives to speak with Sansa and gives her information on how he’s planning to get her out of King’s Landing and back to her family.

<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik12.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>One of the most beautiful places in the Old Town represents Blackwater Bay in the series. This calm spot was once an important transport hub for seafarers arriving in the western part of the city. It has views of both Bokar and Lovrijenac Fort, and Game of Thrones scenes have taken place from all angles of the cove.

<p><strong>Walls of Dubrovnik</strong></p>

<p>Dubrovnik’s City walls have been featured countless times in the Game of Thrones series. One of the most memorable scenes set along the city was in the Season 3 premiere ‘Valar Dohaeris’ when Tyrion and Lord Varys walk along the walls as workers repair the damage from the Battle of Blackwater.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik15.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" />
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik16.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>We bought tickets in advance and we went to the City Walls in the early morning. The gate wasn’t opened yet but people started line up. A couple who were standing next to us came from California. We talked about the TV shows and Dubrovnik’s history. When the gate was opened, we said goodbye to each other. Sometimes, we feel the world is small. Something in common brought us together no matter where we are in the world!</p>

<p><strong>Dominican Monastery / St. Dominic Street</strong></p>

<p>The highlight of St Dominic Street is the Dominican Monastery and it was from the steps of the Monastery that the Season 2, Episode 5 ‘the Ghost Of Harrenhal’ protest speech against the Lannisters was delivered.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik17.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" />

<p><strong>Fort Lovrijenac / The Red Keep</strong></p>

<p>In the Game Of Thrones, Fort Lovrijenac (The Red Keep) is the residence of the King of the Andals and the First Men. It is within King’s Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and dominates the skyline of the city while serving as the city’s primary fortress and redoubt. On this filming location, Cersei and Littlfinger had long conversations in Season 1.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik19.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>The walls facing the sea are up to 12 meters thick, but on the eastern side of the fortress facing Dubrovnik the walls are only 60 centimetres thick. Such construction was done purposely, in case the Fort was taken by an enemy it could easily be destroyed directly from the city walls and fort Bokar.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik20.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>Above the door leading to the fortress there is a famous inscription carved in stone: “Non Bene Pro Toto Libertas Venditur Auro” (“Freedom cannot be sold for all the gold of the world”).
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik21.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>You also might remember from Season 2 episode 1, when Cersei and Littlefinger talk about finding Arya. He lets on that he knows about her relationship with Jamie quoting “knowledge is power.” She threatens his life stating “power is power.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Petyr Baelish: “When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I’ve heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well… that is an awkward situation indeed, especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I’ve found.”</p>

<p>Cersei Lannister: “And which truth is that?”</p>

<p>Petyr Baelish: “Knowledge is power.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ploce Gate</strong></p>

<p>Dubrovnik’s Ploce Gate and Revelin Fortress were used as one of the entrances of The Red Keep. It’s the gate Cersei enters after her walk of shame in season 5 episode 10.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik22.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" />
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik23.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p><strong>The Rector’s Palace</strong>
It featured in Season 2, Episode 6 ‘the Old God’s and the New’ where Daenerys visits the Spice King’s mansion to request ships to carry her army across the Narrow Sea but was refused.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik24.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" />
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik25.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p><strong>The Stradun / Placa</strong></p>

<p>The main street of Dubrovnik, between the Cathedral and Sponza Palace, is lined with shops, cafes and historic buildings. It featured in the Walk of Penance in Season 5, Episode 10 ‘Mother’s Mercy’.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik26.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>Just a couple of hours before thousands of tourists arrive, The Stradun sits empty in the middle of Dubrovnik, Croatia. Because of the sheer amount of tourists that walk here everyday, the stones are polished. One of our favorite things to do while traveling is to wake up very early in the morning and explore. Cities are drastically different before the sun comes up, and Dubrovnik is no exception. Nothing but the sound of birds fills these streets early in the morning.
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik27.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY</strong></p>

<p>As Sansa Stark once said: “Growing up at Winterfell, all I ever wanted was to escape, to come here, to the capital. I wanted to see the southern knights and their painted armor, and King’s Landing after dark. All the candles were burning in all those windows…”
<img src="/image/Europe/Croatia/Dubrovnik28.jpg" alt="Dubrovnik, Croatia" title="Follow in the footsteps of 'Game of Thrones'" /></p>

<p>All she ever wanted was to come to King’s Landing. That’s your dream too? You can escape from your ordinary life and dive into an unforgettable experience of Game of Thrones by coming to Dubrovnik.

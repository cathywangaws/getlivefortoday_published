<p>Venice charms, captivates and seduces with its dazzling and unique beauty, encapsulated in its enchanting buildings and picturesque waterways.</p>

<p>Gondola</p>

<p>This was the highlight in Venice, Italy. It is a must to do in Venice. We shared the Gondola with another two people. They were boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. The boy came from Argentina and the girl come from London to meet at Venice.</p>

<p>Gondola service is everywhere in Venice and they only accept cash.</p>

<p>The sky was getting dark. The Gondola service was closed.</p>

<p>This group of people was singing in Gondola. They were Chinese so they song in Chinese.</p>

<p>Italian Food</p>

<p>The Venetian Streetfood. The taste was better than a restaurant dish:)</p>

<p>Gelato is ice cream made in the Italian style. Gelato is simply the Italian word for ice cream, but in English, it has come to mean specifically Italian or Italian-style ice cream. Gelato is made with a base of milk and sugar. It is generally lower in fat than other styles of ice cream.</p>

<p>Live band.</p>

<p>Bridges</p>

<p>The best way to explore Venice is on foot.</p>

<p>I loved every single second of our time here. What a beautiful, magical place. I could barely stop looking around long enough to catch my breath.</p>

<p>Spent our time just wandering up and down the canals with me snapping a photo at just about every step. I could not put down my camera!</p>

<p>Walking along the winding canals.</p>

<p>walking these streets and taking in the beauty of Venice.</p>

<p>Channel</p>

<p>Venetian policemen on duty.</p>

<p>Piazza San Marco</p>

<p>At Night</p>

<p>Get lost wandering through the narrow alleys.</p>

<p>Transportation</p>

<p>Others</p>

<p>A very romantic place for a meal or a drink.</p>

<p>Shopping at Venice.</p>

<p>We stayed at outside of the island so rode Tram 1 to Venice Island.</p>

<p>Here is the fish market in mornings. The market was just closed at about 10am and it hadn’t been cleaned up yet. I saw they just used power wash to clean the floor and the water ran into Canal! No wonder why the Canal smells fishy!

<p>阿城的”威尼斯的日记“值得一读 – 威尼斯像舞台布景，游客是临时演员“，我们也有幸充两天的角色。
另外”地中海沿岸的种族的混合，包括东方的阿拉伯人、南方的北非人、北方的“蛮族”。这种混合的结果，就是意大利的男女非常好看，腿修长有力，脖子精致，额头饱满，腰部微妙，像脸一样的有表情。天生的卷发和暗色皮肤的人非常多“。</p>

Driving along the coast and stunning views – A road trip from Los Angeles to San Diego, CA!
It was Friday afternoon. I was checking the flight to Seattle. Flight status looked good for standbys but I wasn’t sure if it would be a good time to visit Mt Rainier National Park. The park is at high elevation so the temperature will be colder than sea level.">

<p>Driving along the coast and stunning views – A road trip from Los Angeles to San Diego, CA!</p>

<p>It was Friday afternoon. I was checking the flight to Seattle. Flight status looked good for standbys but I wasn’t sure if it would be a good time to visit Mt Rainier National Park. The park is at high elevation so the temperature will be colder than sea level. When I checked the road status, most of roads in the park were still covered by snow and they were not opened to visitors yet. So I was hesitated to go there!</p>

<p>Finally made the decision to fly to LAX, road trip to San Diego, and fly back from SAN. The total distance is about 120 miles that would be a good day trip.</p>

<p>This week had been crazy busy at work so wanted to get relax after work at Friday. It was a warm day in Chicago so I wanted to have a cold IPA beer before flying out of town. The beer made me feel better and forgot about the work.</p>

<p>The movie of The Post is available in the flight so I started watching it on my phone. However the work in this week really worn me out and I just slept for about 4 hours at Thursday night. Because I had to work on a production change at that night until 2am.  I felt asleep before the flight took off. So I didn’t get a chance to watch this movie. Hopefully I will be able to watch it in my next trip.</p>

<p>The flight landed at LAX airport on time. Took the shuttle bus to the Hertz. It was so crowded rental facility. Five Star row was almost out of cars. I always prefer to have an American Car instead of Japanese Car because American Car feels more solid and heavy base. So it makes me feel safer when driving.</p>

<p>Checked in the hotel at about 11pm. Next day, got up at 6am. It was about 6 hours sleep that wasn’t too bad. At 7:20am started the road trip. First stop was Redondo beach on California Hwy 1. Many morning exercise on this beach. Perfect walking, running, or biking. It is a nice beach with trail and clean sand. You can hear wave sound when you do workout over there. No wonder why lot of people like live in CA. Weather is so mild and sunny.  A great place for living! Do I like here for living?</p>

<p>When I heard the wave sound from the Ocean, I forgot everything in my mind. It was so peaceful and air is so fresh. A perfect place for relaxing! A perfect place for escape from home!</p>

<p>Next destination was Huntington Beach that is about 1 hour away down south of CA. Here is called surf city. It must be a popular place for surfing! I don’t know how to swim so I always stay away from the water. These kind of water activities are not in my bucket list but I’d like to watch others!</p>

<p>There were events at this beach. Watched international sand volleyball games that is US against Cuba. Volleyball player look so pretty. They all have very fit body with long legs:) They play volleyball so well! I enjoyed watching their games.</p>

<p>Played at Huntington Beach for couple of hours then had a quick lunch. Deep fried shrimps. They tasted so good and I forgot they are considered unhealthy food. Well there are not too much choices  when travel. Have to eat what you can find!</p>

<p>Picked few seashells on Huntington beach. Sometimes, a gift doesn’t have to be found from a store. If it has a meaning, it is a priceless gift. It is about how you think about it. It is also about the moment in your mind! It is all about your mood!</p>

<p>Headed to the next destination after a quick lunch. Per the map, the route from Los Angeles to San Diego is about 2 hour trip. We started at noon so the traffic was really bad. It took almost 3 hours.</p>

<p>That was the toll road and no booth to pay so you have to remember the website and then pay later. The rental car doesn’t cover this fee so have to pay it online. It was about 8 dollars.</p>

<p>Finally, reached the destination La Jolla Caves Beach in San Diego. It was a snorkeling area. Water color is beautiful and both side of this beach are caves. The waves were strong and higher here so it was easy to get splashed.</p>

<p>Then walked along the coastal. People were kayaking. Lot of birds stand on cliffs. Sea lions lay down on rocks and make noises sometimes. Another side of the ocean is the city. The view is stunning and peaceful.</p>

<p>At about 4pm, did window shopping in the town. Many small shops with their unique items. The most shops that I like are galleries for images, paintings etc. I wish I could be a photographer and took beautiful landscape pictures.</p>

<p>Then we had dinner at a Thai restaurant in the town. Deep fried tofu for appetizer, seafood for main course and Thai dessert at the end. Had a satisfied dinner. The food wasn’t too rich so it was perfect for me.</p>

<p>Had another stroll by the ocean after dinner. It was Sunset time. The color changed to golden. Many people walked on rocks. Saw sea lions just few feet away. They are so friendly.</p>

<p>Then headed to the airport. San Diego airport looks new. It is not a big airport so it looks pretty quiet.</p>

<p>Flew the red-eye flight back home in next day morning!</p>

          <p>Took a week off even though I was very busy at work. My mom planned to go back to China in April. I had to drop her off at our hometown from Windsor, to Chicago, to Beijing, to Shenyang. It was a long trip and would across three countries, Canada, US, and China.</p>

<p>Andy took the Friday off so he flew to Detroit and rented a SUV from Hertz and then drove to Windsor to pick my mom up. He stayed at my mom’s place overnight and Andy drove with my mom back from Windsor to Chicago because all flights from DTW to ORD were oversold at Friday. I picked them up at O’Hare Hertz facility. They were hungry after 6 hours on the road.</p>

<p>We went to Minghin Chinese Cruise for the dinner. My mom lost several of her teeth so she could only eat soft food. We ordered some dim sum and tofu for the dinner. She liked the food and could eat them. I was happy about it.</p>

<p>At Saturday morning 3/31/2018, we left the house at 8am to head to the airport. It was raining hard at the time we left the house but the rain stopped when we parked our car at United Airlines Reservation Center Campus to wait for the American Taxi. The weather was damp but not too cold.</p>

<p>The flight to PEK was on schedule. Boarding would start at 12 noon. There were 7 standbys for the first class cabin and we were at 4th, 5th, 6th positions. We got one first class seat and two business seats. It was great. We could sit back and relax on the flight for 13 hours. Thanks for United!</p>

<p>I always enjoyed both services and food at United first class cabin. It has better wine than business class cabin and food is also better prepared than business class cabin. I started with Champain before departure.</p>

<p>And then I swtiched to either white wine or red wine. It depends on my mood!</p>

<p>Enjoyed United first class cabin meal. It started with snacks and I had white wine. The first course was Tuna. The second course was sweet potato hot soup. The third course was mango salad. The fourth course was salmon hot plate. The fifth course was international cheese with dessert port wine. At the end of the mean, the sixth course was ice cream and cakes. The meal was well prepared and presentation was nice too. It would be hard to sit at back of the flight if you had such great service and meal during the long flight.</p>

<p>It was sleeping time after meal. You could make your seat to 180 degree flat bed so you would get good rest at business cabin and first/global cabin. We all slept for couple of hours during the flight.</p>

<p>The flight arrived at PEK airport on time. We crossed the Chinese Custom. Then headed to domestic terminal. We bought airfares from PEN to SHE via Air China in the same day. So we rode the airport transit from international terminal to the domestic terminal. Everything was smooth. We got onboard on time but we sit in the flight for about one and half hours without any announcement. This time was so long and uncertain because we as customers didn’t know neither the departure time nor arrival  time. Finally the flight got takeoff and the flight attendant said the air control caused delay! After another one and half hours flight, we landed at Shenyang international airport. Andy’s brother and one of my cousins picked us up at the airport. It was about 11pm at Sunday 4/1/2016. We finally reached our destination after about 24 hours trip.</p>

<p>We dropped my mom at another cousin’s apartment where she plans to stay during her visiting. It is a three bedrooms apartment with furniture. It looks so nice so clean. It is a 11 story high raised building with elevator and the apartment is at 10th floor. Everything looks perfect and hope my mom can enjoy her stay over there!</p>

<p>I didn’t stay with my mom. I went to my brother in law’s apartment. That is the place I feel comfortable and feel homey because I always stay there whenever I visit to my hometown (3 times in 20 years). It is a two level apartment on 16th floor in a building and they give me the whole second floor to stay and they live at lower level. So I get my own bedroom and bathroom etc. I get my privacy!</p>

<p>Maybe my cousins wouldn’t understand why I didn’t stay with my mom. Maybe I surprised them very much because of my behavior. I am really not a person who can stay anywhere. I need my comforty if I could!</p>

<p>Every morning, my sister in law got up earlier than us and cooked breakfast for us. In my memory, she didn’t cook at all but now she is very good at it. She told me she learned cooking for her son. Her son is 11 years old now and we call him Bell. Bell has very long eye lashes and big eyes. He inherits all his parent’s advantages. A handsome boy! He didn’t like taking pictures so I didn’t have a chance to take a picture with me. I also told him call my Cathy, not aunt. I don’t know how to be an aunt. He may get confused so he never calls me anything!</p>

<p>I like the style of their apartment, modern but with Chinese culture. They even have a game room with tea service.My sister in law also has one big room only for her own clothes. Three of them live in a such big apartment. So luxury!</p>

<p>I felt so comfortable. They really treat me so nice! If I could do the same for them when they visit me? I think they are better than me regarding this! I appreciated everything they did for me!</p>

<p>This time was a pure family visiting, not vacation. I had been living abroad for 20 years and this visit was my first time for family visiting. I have relatives at my hometown but I barely visit them during my short stays before! I did this in this trip because my mom needs to stay at here for half a year and she needs their help so I had to meet them up! They are about same age like me and they are all very nice people and they all have good jobs. Glad I met them since they are always busy!</p>

<p>I had only 4 full days at my hometown so each day I had full schedule. I got sick because the weather change. I had sore throat, running nose, and lost my voice. My sister in law made hot brown sugar ginger soup for me at first night when I arrived. I felt sleep after drank it but my throat was dry and sore at midnight. I felt so sick! However I didn’t have time to get rest during the day. I had to run errands as my planned!</p>

<p>Day 1 – Monday 4/2/2018</p>

<p>Couldn’t wake up without coffee. Had to head out for a cup of coffee and found this bakery store has latte. So I bought a cup of latte with a fresh baked cheese bread. The bread smelled so sweet and ate so soft. I liked it very much and wished I could have one more. However, the latte tasted just like milk without too much coffee aroma.</p>

<p>Took a week off even though I was very busy at work. My mom planned to go back to China in April. I had to drop her off at our hometown from Windsor, to Chicago, to Beijing, to Shenyang. It was a long trip and would across three countries, Canada, US, and China.</p>

<p>Andy took the Friday off so he flew to Detroit and rented a SUV from Hertz and then drove to Windsor to pick my mom up.

<p>Day 1 – Monday 4/2/2018</p>

<p>Couldn’t wake up without coffee. Had to head out for a cup of coffee and found this bakery store has latte. So I bought a cup of latte with a fresh baked cheese bread. The bread smelled so sweet and ate so soft. I liked it very much and wished I could have one more. However, the latte tasted just like milk without too much coffee aroma.</p>

<p>One of my aunts from my mom’s side was in the hospital and she was reached the end of her life so I had to see her as soon as possible. She was in coma so she couldn’t recognize me. There were many tubes into her body. A life was just about ending! Should not we value our life when we are still healthy! Should not we cherish every day when we live in this world! I live for today because I know life is short and I don’t want to give myself regrets! Quality of my life is more important than quantity of my life!</p>

<p>In the evening, all relatives from my mom’s side who lives in Shenyang had a dinner together. We drank beers. We talked but I couldn’t remember what we talked about at the end. All I could say is we are all different. We are on our own!</p>

<p>Day 2 – Tuesday 4/3/2018</p>

<p>Today’s plan was visiting my aunt who is my father’s younger sister. My father has only one sibling and also lives in the same city. I always visit her whenever I was in Shenyang because I felt closer to her. I brought Q10 nutritions for her from US and also stopped by at a big supermarket and bought other stuff for her. She looks healthy. She is a positive person and she is always happy. We went to a dumpling restaurant for lunch. The food was delicious. So I ate a lot and was so full. It is easy to over eat in China because every dish is very tasty and there are so many kinds of dishes. China has very rich food culture!</p>

<p>We went to the hospital with my mom again to visit my second aunt who is my mom’s second older sister. She has only one son and they lived together. When my mom saw her sister, she knew it was just about time. All her organs were exhausted and no medicine treatment could help. The doctor also talked to us about the situation. I think there was no regrets because she had a good life! She was peaceful at the end. That is about a life. Don’t leave any regrets when you live. Just do it! There is no tomorrow waiting for you because you have other things need to do tomorrow!</p>

<p>I took this picture at about 3pm. The sky is not clear but I am not sure it is a cloudy day or bad air pollution. I saw some people wear face mask.</p>

<p>Day 3 – Wednesday 4/4/2018</p>

<p>Andy’s brother took a day off so he could drive us to visit my grandparents and my father’s graves. They all at a same cemetery but it is about 2 hours drive. We got up and left earlier because visiting graves need to be done in morning that is a Chinese culture. My grandma died at 1993 and my father died at 1994. I didn’t see my grandpa at all. They left us too early. My father wanted me to go abroad but he didn’t know it because I went to Canada at 1998. I believe that was his regret! My parents got along very well. They were high school classmates and then my mom went to a medical university and my father went to a technical university. They got married after they graduated. They took a picture at photo studio at their married month each year and they kept this tradition for a long time. Since they had good relationship, the whole family was warm and happy. So both my brother and I could grow up in a healthy environment and they provided us good education. I am luckier than other kids at my generation. I could have almost everything I wanted. My father spoiled me a lot. My mom was a sharp and smart woman. She got respect from her career and even now she still helps others on medical. People trust her medical knowledge and experience and she is happy to help other seniors. However, I can see she is getting older. I start worry about her a lot. Hope she can take care of her self very well!</p>

<p>This picture was taken in their 2nd year marriage. I think I look like my father more than my mother!</p>

<p>On the way back to the city, we stopped at a nursing home. I just wanted to take a look what a Chinese senior nuring home looks like. It is a good place for active seniors.</p>

<p>After we finished this event, we went to a Korean style restaurant and my sister in law also joined us during her lunch break at work. I ordered my special ribs that I could not find in North America. It was lean meat and cooked in a simple way by water with seasonings. Just need to dip sauce when eat it. Andy doesn’t eat it at all.</p>

<p>Then we had table grill with dried seasonings. The thin sliced beef tasted so good after the charcoal grill. When I was a child, I lived near the Korean Village. I went there often for meals. Now the taste is still same like the childhood taste. It was a very satisfied lunch! Again I was over eating!</p>

<p>In the evening, I went out to meet my friend, Michael. We went to a Starbucks instead of a restaurant. I felt I couldn’t eat anymore. I was still so full. He is my best friend at my hometown. Actually, I think I didn’t have any other friends left at my hometown except him. I am bad at keep long term relationship with friends. Anyway that is me. Chinese always like making friends so they will have complicated social networks. They like that but I don’t. I prefer to have few best friends and keep in touch once a while!</p>

<p>Day 4 – Thursday 4/5/2018</p>

<p>With my sister in law at her apartment.</p>

<p>Today was my last day in Shenyang. Another cousin and her husband wanted to meet me. They picked me up and then drove to a hotel and had latte at the hotel bar. I haven’t seen my cousin’s husband since I went to abroad so I was so surprised he show up. He is a big leader at China Telecom company so we are at different level. He brought me some very expensive gifts, like the most expensive Chinese liquor, the best Cuban handmade cigars, expensive silk scarf, and special limited tea. I didn’t want to accept them but they insist. I am not interested in those luxury stuff. I just wanted to taste them before. Now I knew what Cuban cigar tastes like. So I don’t want them anymore. I left cigars and liquor to Andy’s brother. We chatted here and there. Their daughter was in Wisconsin for two years. Actually I didn’t help her too much.</p>

<p>After chat, we went to see my mom together. As usual, they brought very expensive stuff for her. My mom is my cousin’s 3rd aunt.</p>

<p>Then I met another cousin who came from suburbs and will stay with my mom and take care of my mom. That makes me feel better and little less worry about my mom in Shenyang. This cousin is my first aunt’s son and he got retired last year and now he is 63 years old. He looks younger than his age. I really hope he could stay with my mom for half a year. My mom needs to get her dentures done so she definitely needs a company to see dentist. I am not familiar with this cousin but my mom likes him. I gave him 1000 RMB as gift because i didn’t buy anything from US as gifts and I think cash is the best gift in China!</p>

<p>We had Hot Pot dinner together.</p>

<p>My mom’s side has 7 siblings so I have many cousins. This time, many cousins gave us huge support, like stay at the apartment that is my second aunt’s son’s and another cousin who is my first aunt’s son to take care of my mom. I did nothing to them but they are doing all these important things for me and for my mom. I don’t know how to express my appreciation except giving money to them!</p>

<p>Day 5 – Friday 4/6/2018</p>

<p>It was light snow in the morning in April. Chicago also had snow this week but it was melt next day.</p>

<p>There were so many people at railway station ticketing lobby. People still have to buy paper tickets at railway station.</p>

<p>Got time to have a cup of latte and my favoriate dessert.</p>

<p>We left at 6:30am and Andy’s brother dropped us off at Shenyang railway station  for 8am express train to Beijing. The total time is only about 4 hours from Shenyang to Beijing by express train. That is very convenience.</p>

<p>The suburbs near Beijing.</p>

<p>After arrived at Beijing South train station, need to take subway, and then take airport express train to PEK airport.</p>

<p>Today needed to go back to Beijing because the flight to Chicago changed to 12pm departure. We had to stay at Beijing overnight. I found that flight to Washington DC was 6:20pm departure and it was Boeing 787 – Dreamliner and there were 8 business seats open with 4 standbys. So we decided to give it a try today.</p>

<p>Got United Polaris seats. This is my first time to fly Polaris Business Class.</p>

<p>Experienced the Dreamliner aircraft. Also experienced United Polaris business cabin. I got good rest during 13 hours flight. Hope I don’t have jet leg next week!</p>

<p>One week vacation is over. My mom is in China now. I need to focus on my work since the project will go live next month. Meanwhile I need to do workout and exercise in order to keep healthy life! I will go back to China in half a year to pick up my mom back!</p>

<p>We were trying to avoid jet leg so we cooked Chinese dumplings together in order to keep ourselves busy so we can forget about jet leg.</p>

<p>Comments from Andy after posting:
Writing diary is very a great habit! I am sure we will feel different when we read this again in the future. Thanks for writing this down. Keep up this!</p>

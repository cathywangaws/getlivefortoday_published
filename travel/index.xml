A day trip to Miami, FL. Left home at 4am in the morning and back home at 10pm in the evening. Was at Miami about 4 hours but it was a surprised and unplanned trip! The flight was already full. I didn’t think I could have a chance! The departure time was at 7:10am and we got assigned seats at 7am. It was really a surprise. The sky was still dark at 7am.</description>

      <description>Protected: Big Sur, CA 2018-12-27 No Comments
Big Sur is a rugged stretch of California’s central coast between Carmel and San Simeon. Bordered to the east by the Santa Lucia Mountains and the west by the Pacific Ocean, it’s traversed by narrow, 2-lane State Route 1, known for winding turns, seaside cliffs and views of the often-misty coastline. The sparsely populated region has numerous state parks for hiking, camping and beachcombing.</description>

      <description>A short trip to Dallas, TX. This was my 2nd time to land at DFW airport. A couple of years ago, I was here for a Microsoft Ignite Training where was located in Irving, TX. I did some travel research about Dallas but it seems a little boring city for me because I was looking for some outdoor activities. However, Dallas is a very flat area without mountains. I wasn’t able to find things that I really wanted to explore.</description>

      <description>The movie of La La Land explores the joy and pain of pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles, CA. I watched this movie last year. It was a great story even though they couldn’t be together at the end but the girl fulfilled her dream in Hollywood.
I haven’t visited La La Land for couple of years so we flew to LAX at midnight of 4/12/2019. It was poppy flower season.</description>

      <description>O Canada! Our home and native land!
True patriot love in all of us command.
 Canada was the first foreign country where I went abroad. I dealt with a new language, new way of thinking, new culture, which opened my eyes and changed my perspective of life completely.
Windsor, Ontario Canada is the place actually changed me. I consider it as my second hometown because not only I got my CS degree but my mom is living there.</description>

      <description>Up there with Times Square in USA, Red Square in Russia, and St. Peter’s Square in Rome, Tiananmen Square in China is among the world’s most famous public spaces. It is the heart of Beijing, China.
                The square is the geographic, political and tourist center of the city, which makes it unavoidable. When I came back from my hometown to Beijing by night train, I made a quick visit at Oct 30, 2019.</description>

      <description>I gave myself a homework. I need to write a post on my blog after my each trip or adventure. I have came back from China for couple of days but my mind is not calm and I don’t know how to writ down this trip still. It is complicated. This trip mixed with some elements that I hadn’t been experienced yet!
A month ago before my vacation, I borrowed about 20 travel books from the library because I was planning to go to Africa or Europe.</description>

      <description>The sea is filled with water, With high and low tides. When we go near it, We feel that we are in paradise! The warmth of the sand touching the feet, The feel of the breeze with a welcoming greet. The sight of the people playing on the shore, Makes my heart roar likes never before! Time flew by as I tried explorer, The beautiful treasures yet the sea bore. Feeling satisfied we flew home, With memories to cherish forever more!</description>

      <description>There is no better way to take in the foliage than adventuring outside! This year, Andy and I flew to Albany, NY and then drove about one and half hours to Catskills Mountains in New York State on October 12, 2019. We did the Catskills Mountains Scenic Drive. The roads are winding and surrounded by dense forest with gentle change in elevation. It is a perfect Fall destination. The roads were quiet without too much traffic.</description>

      <description>We were in Sodona, Arizona - the land of red rocks. Flew to Phoenix, AZ airport and then drove 2 hours to Sedona area for a day trip at November 16, 2019. It was a sunny and beautiful day. The temperature was about 70ish degrees without any wind. Arizona is a great escape destination from the cold weather. The song of 500 Miles Away From Home was a perfect song for this scenic road trip.</description>

      <description>“We must be free not because we claim freedom, but because we practice it.” – William Faulkner  This year the independence holiday is Thursday so we took Friday off in order to have a long weekend. I spent 3 hours to find a less crowded flight routes at Tuesday night but seems like not possible. All flights were full with negative numbers. Lot of Americans would travel around the world during this summer that made standby was difficult.</description>

      <description>Took a week off even though I was very busy at work. My mom planned to go back to China in April. I had to drop her off at our hometown from Windsor, to Chicago, to Beijing, to Shenyang. It was a long trip and would across three countries, Canada, US, and China.
Andy took the Friday off so he flew to Detroit and rented a SUV from Hertz and then drove to Windsor to pick my mom up.</description>

Flying Home</p>

<p>Time to flying home after my adventure. Since I skipped visiting the Carlsbad Caverns National Park, I decided to go home one day earlier as my planned. ABQ is a small airport so United doesn’t have many flights. This could cause the difficulty for standbys. I checked almost all options to fly back to ORD and finally decide to try a morning flight to Houston which is One of United hubs.</p>

<p>I got up at 4:45am, had breakfast at 5:20am in the hotel, returned the rental car at about 5:45, and then took shuttle to the terminal.</p>

<p>Albuquerque to Houston express flight was full and only one standby got the seat. I was at second position but unluckily I didn’t get a seat. So I had to think other options at the gate.</p>

<p>At about 8am, I bought discount tickets to Los Angeles. I saw few seats open in this flight but I didn’t want to take the chance for standbys anymore because I wanted to be home by today. It has been few days travel so I missed my home and I wanted take a hot shower and have a good and relax.</p>

<p>There was about 30 minutes connection time. I wasn’t sure if I could catch the next flight. When I opened the United app to check flight status from LAX to ORD, it was delayed. That made me feel better since I won’t worry I would miss the connection.</p>

<p>I got assigned tickets before onboarding. I was so happy. I would be home soon!</p>

<p>5/28/2018 Monday</p>

<p>Santa Fe, NM</p>

<p>Santa Fe, NM – the second oldest city in the United States and at 7,000 feet above sea level, the highest capital city in the country.</p>

<p>Santa Fe isn’t a big city but it has an Old World feeling when you stroll in downtown.</p>

<p>First, had lunch at a Chinese restaurant where the food tasted very good and plate presentation was decent.</p>

<p>Then we went to the historic sites: The oldest house and oldest church in the US. The Palace of the Governors, the oldest government building in the USA. Under the building’s portal (the overhang) you can buy Native American handcrafts as a souvenir of your visit, directly from the artisans who crafted them.</p>

<p>Santa Fe, New Mexico’s capital, sits in the Sangre de Cristo foothills. It’s renowned for its Pueblo-style architecture and as a creative arts hotbed. Founded as a Spanish colony in 1610, it has at its heart the traditional Plaza. The surrounding historic district’s crooked streets wind past adobe landmarks.</p>

<p>The “City of Faith” is also home to a few miracles, like the Loretto Chapel’s circular wooden steps. Built by an unidentified man who is said to have shown up at the chapel in 1879 with a donkey and a toolbox, his staircase has two 360-degree turns, no visible means of support and wooden pegs instead of metal nails. Some faithful at the time believed that the mystery man was St. Joseph.</p>

<p>The unofficial state question: “red or green,” is asking which type of chile you want your food smothered in. If you answer “Christmas,” you’ll get both. Great and reasonably priced places to sample New Mexican food.</p>

<p>In this picture, this senior couple touched me. They walked on the street and the husband held the wife hand. They show their love and care to each other. I can see their happiness and peace. The hand-made rugs in this store look beautiful but this couple is extremely beautiful and in love. Nothing is more important than love.</p>

<p>It was another hot day so I bought an coffee flavor ice cream. I also bought a ring from the artisan.</p>

<p>Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument</p>

<p>The texture of pure gypsum sand is like no other sand. It is fine powder-soft texture to shift through your fingers.</p>

<p>An unique nature wonder</p>

<p>you see legions of cone-shaped rock formations among beige, pink and white-colored cliffs.</p>

<p>The name Kasha-Katuwe, meaning “white cliffs,” comes from the traditional Keresan language of the Cochiti Pueblo inhabitants who live nearby</p>

<p>Hiking at Tent Rocks</p>

<p>Hiked 4.5 miles at Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument, New Mexico.</p>

<p>Canyon Trail</p>

<p>If you’re up for a challenge and some rewarding views, this is the path for you.The 3-mile round trip (out and back) on the Canyon Trail first takes you along a sandy path through a mixture of evergreens and desert landscape. The finely balanced boulders towering high above the trail are an intimidating but awe-inspiring sight. About a half-mile into your journey, you’ll begin to experience the amazing contrast of light and shadow that is unique to slot canyons. Wandering through this narrow, contoured arroyo is a spectacular treat. Along the rock-strewn corridor, you’ll have the chance to marvel at the exposed root system of a mighty ponderosa pine.</p>

<p>Once you emerge from the slender gorge, prepare for a climb that would make the Tin Man’s heart beat out of his chest…if he only had one. The 630 feet of elevation gain to the top of the mesa may cause you to click your heels three times and long for home but hang in there.</p>

<p>Once you reach the apex of the path, you will be treated to a visual feast that includes the Tent Rocks below as well as the Rio Grande Valley and the Sangre de Cristo, Jemez and Sandia Mountains. Once you’ve caught your breath and snapped all the photos you care to take, you can descend the trail and enjoy the journey in reverse on your way back to the parking lot.</p>

<p>Cave Loop Trail</p>

<p>If the steep ascent and dizzying heights of the Canyon Trail cause your courage to waver like the Cowardly Lion, fear not. The Cave Loop Trail (1.2 miles long) will still provide you with an excellent opportunity to explore Tent Rocks. From the parking lot, you follow the same trail toward the slot canyon for the first half-mile. Then at the junction, turn left, and you’ll be on your way along the fairly level ground to the cave for which this trail is named.</p>

<p>Before you arrive at this ancient dwelling, you should notice both the cholla and prickly pear variety of cactus. Cholla is a tall, “stick-man”-looking cactus with neon pink blooms followed by yellow fruit. Prickly pear is a smaller, ground-level cactus with lots of pads and purple fruit.​</p>

<p>Once at the cave, you might wonder why it is so high off the ground. Apparently ancestral Native Americans preferred caves that were above ground level because they stayed dry during storms, were more difficult for animals to enter and provided a view of the surrounding territory in case of enemy attack. The small size of the cave opening is because ancestral Native American adults were shorter than they are today. If you climb up to the opening you’ll see smoke stains on the ceiling, a sure-fire indicator that the cave was indeed used by these ancestral peoples. After your cave visit, complete the loop by descending the trail back down to the parking lot.</p>

<p>The Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks National Monument is a remarkable outdoor laboratory, offering an opportunity to observe, study, and experience the geologic processes that shape natural landscapes. The National Monument, on the Pajarito Plateau in north-central New Mexico, includes a national recreation trail and ranges from 5,570 feet to 6,760 feet above sea level. It is for foot travel only, and contains two segments that provide opportunities for hiking, birdwatching, geologic observation, and plant identification.</p>

<p>The cone-shaped tent rock formations are the products of volcanic eruptions that occurred 6 to 7 million years ago and left pumice, ash, and tuff deposits over 1,000 feet thick. Tremendous explosions from the Jemez volcanic field spewed pyroclasts (rock fragments), while searing hot gases blasted down slopes in an incandescent avalanche called a pyroclastic flow.</p>

<p>5/27/2018 Sunday</p>

<p>Taos Pueblo Village, NM
Today’s plan was skip the cave and head to Taos Pueblo Village, NM. It would take 5 hours driving. I was looking forward to seeing Adobe architecture.</p>

<p>Walking past the doorways of the multi-storied homes still occupied today by 300 people is an experienced unmatched anywhere else.</p>

<p>New Mexico is a desert state. The weather is hot and dry. It is not a very tourist state but there are few things are very unique. I think it is worth to visit once but not sure if it needs to come back.</p>

<p>Taos Pueblo is the only living Native American community designated both a World Heritage Site by UNESCO and a National Historic Landmark.</p>

<p>5/26/2018 – Journey to White
Climbing, smiling, laughing and making it an adventure to remember!
White Sands National Monument in New Mexico has to be one of the most beautiful places in the United States. I had been to other sand dunes, Death Valley Sand Dunes in CA, Sleeping Bear and Silver Lake Sand Dunes in MI, and Indiana Dunes in IN. However, this is really the most beautiful Dunes that I have ever seen in my life. The weather was hot and windy but the sky was blue with little clouds in the afternoon. It would be a perfect timing to explore here at this moment!
The further we drove into the dunes, the less we could see of the road, and at some point it was covered in sand completely. We were in a white world!
It was somewhat surreal, since had been driving through the desert of New Mexico for a while without even seeing any sand dunes yet, and within a couple of minutes, I suddenly was surrounded by them completely. What a such incredible wonderland! No words can express what I saw at the moment but immerse into this atmosphere.
After climbed to the top of a bright white sand dune, the only things I saw were blue sky and white sand. This was incredibly beautiful. I felt the freedom in this white world. I could forget everything and just walked on this soft white sand forever with my barefoot. I started running to next dune and looked the endless white sands. What a wonderful moment that I had now. Travel opened my eyes to see the world and scenery opened my heart to feel the special moment!
The dunes sit in the Tularosa Basin and had actually been part of a massive lake during the last ice age. After the lake dried out, it left a large area of gypsum on the surface, which were broken into sand-size grains over thousands of years through erosion and weathering. The winds that blow over the basin eventually formed the sand dunes. Depending on wind and weather, they actually change their shapes all the time.
This is why it is nearly impossible for any plants to grow in White Sands – if the plants are not very resistant and fast-growing, they get blown over by the moving sand quickly and don’t survive.</p>

<p>I had planned to hike the Alkali Flat Trail (4.5 mile round-trip, at least 3 hours). By the time I reached the trail head, it was close to 90F and the desert sand blew on my face that made me barely could open my eyes. The further I walked into the dunes, the quieter it got without seeing the trail markers. This made me nervous to continue my hiking because the wind would erase my footprint and I would get lost in the middle of white desert easily. So I decided to just play at nearby the parking lot and always looked around to remember the way I had walked through. In fact, several hikers have gone lost in White Sands, overestimating their ability to walk without water or underestimating the heat.</p>

<p>Followed the 8-mile scenic drive and stopped at the ‘heart of the sand’ area that was a filmed area, like the video of Puff Daddy’s ‘best friend’. The peace and quiet were very relaxing.</p>

<p>Did some photo shooting as well. Since it was a beautiful and unique landscape, even though I don’t have any photographer’s professional experience, I was still able to take some postcard like pictures with my Nikon D5600.</p>

<p>After stayed in the park for about 3 hours that the heat worn me out. Drove to the hotel without watching the sunset that didn’t make me to feel regret at all. I saw and did everything I wanted in White Sands National Monument. I got an unforgettable afternoon during this Memorial Holiday in year 2018!</p>

<p>We also had a picnic at White Sands. The picnic shelter looks so cute and block the wind. It is a very well maintained park and security trucks drive around to make sure people are safe here!</p>

<p>Pistachio Tour in NM</p>

<p>It is easy to get a roadside attraction when you have a cross-country trip. Saw a billboard about Pistachio Land. So decided to visit this wonderful and unplanned place as a side trip!</p>

<p>Now I know Pistachios are not nuts. The greenish meat inside split shell is seed of a fruit. Just like peaches or plums where an outer freshly part surrounds a shell with seed inside. In the case of pistachios, we eat the seed inside the pit.</p>

<p>Pistachios are now commercially grown in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. The tour guide was friendly and has sense of humor. He told us that male pistachio trees are not nuts and female pistachio trees are nuts. That means male tree doesn’t have fruits and only female trees produce fruits! Usually male trees are taller than female trees.</p>

<p>The flowers grow that require both male and female trees to ensure production. The fruits get ripening in the autumn.</p>

<p>After the tour, shopped the store. Sampled many kinds of flavor pistachios and had a pistachio ice cream to comple this tour!</p>

<p>A botanical journey of touring the pistachio orchard in NM. Learning the fantastic history of ancient tree and sampled flavored pistachios.</p>

<p>5/26/2017 Saturday</p>

<p>White Sand National Monument was the most important stop for this trip. I was looking forward to seeing this white sands dunes.</p>

<p>Got up pretty early and had breakfast at 6:30 at Hyatt Place, Albuquerque NM. Then headed to White Sands National Monument. My planning was arriving there in the afternoon and could play with sands for couple of hours. May also watch sunset at about 8pm if didn’t feel tired.</p>

<p>It was about 3.5 hours drive. New Mexico is a desert state so driving was pretty boring. Glad I have Spotify and listened to my favorite songs.</p>

<p>Saw a Walmart on the road so decided to buy water, energy drinks, fruits, snacks, and picnic meal. I was planning to have lunch in the park that would give me a different picnic experience!</p>

<p>Driving in desert freeway is pretty easy. The road is straight, flat and less traffic.</p>

<p>Looking outside through the window. It was sunny day. Could hear the wind from outside sometimes. It must be a windy summer day in New Mexico. I saw mountains that was far away from the freeway. So I decided to take a break to feel the desert air.</p>

<p>At about 11:45am, reached Alamogordo town and saw a Pistachio Orchard. That wasn’t on my to-do list but I knew New Mexico is famous of pistachios. It was about another one hour drive from here to White Sands so I had plenty of time and it would be a good opportunity to learn about Pistachio!</p>

<p>5/25/2018 Friday</p>

<p>Memorial holiday is a busy travel weekend. Many people are out of town for a vacation and I have same idea as others. I am taking 2 days off so I can plan to go somewhere. First of all, I wanted to go to Iceland. I spent few days and whole weekend to make my travel plans. However, the flight looked so full when the day was coming closer. I didn’t think I would have a chance to get on the flight. I had to make another plan. I did some homework about Lake Tahoe, CA. It is a beautiful place for hiking and scenery but it is spring time over there. It means the snow hasn’t got fully melt yet. The hiking will be difficult without right gear. I thought it was too early to visit over there in May. By all means, I have to find another destination to go for this long weekend. I started to think about a place warm and sunny. Then I decided to visit New Mexico State. I have never been there yet and I saw white sand pictures from my friend’s moments. These white sands caught my eyes and I decided to go to Albuquerque, NM. There are three things I want to see in New Mexico. 1 is White Sands National Monument. 2 is Adobe architecture in Santa Fe, NM. 3 is hiking in caves. I made the plan based on my interest.</p>

<p>I headed to CTA blue line after work. I saw so many people waiting for the subway. I wasn’t sure why. Then I saw the delay alert from the schedule monitor at platform. I realized that I couldn’t get on a subway even it comes because of so many passengers. I had to find another way to go to the airport. It was 4pm at Friday afternoon. If I took a cab to the airport, it wasn’t guaranteed I could save me time to be there quickly. Another solution was take a metra train back to suburbs and then cab to the airport. This sounds very reasonable and won’t get too much traffic involved. I got on 4:39 train and it arrived at Des Plaines at 5:09. Then got on a cab right away. Finally, I arrived at ORD at 5:30. I felt a big relief. ABQ is my last travel plan. If I missed the flight, I didn’t know what I would do!</p>

<p>There were some people waiting at TSA but the line wasn’t too bad. I had enough time for dinner before take off. It was United Express flight but there were still some empty seats. The flight took off at 7:20pm on time. My adventure starts at right here.</p>

<p>Landed at Albuquerque, NM after two and half hours flight.</p>

<p>5/20/2018 Sunday</p>

<p>My weekend domestic trip usually don’t have to make a plan. I will have to do homework if a trip is more than 2 or 3 days. I always prefer to have a good plan before I fly out to a new country.</p>

<p>Usually, my travel research time is longer than my trip because I want to know some details, routes, and other conditions and then I put them into Google Drive. So I can download them and read offline. It is easier than carrying print out papers.</p>

<p>I always like mother of nature and skip cities. So I try to find remote places to explore. This may cause difficulties to find a nicer hotel and maybe no hotel at all. I consider these kind of trips are my adventures! So I have to prepare lot of stuff in case I couldn’t find them or take too much time to find them. I want to save my time on adventures.</p>

<p>United Airlines will have a new seasonal route to Iceland this summer. It is still May now so the peak travel season hasn’t started. I bet I would have a chance to explore over there during this Memorial holiday. I finished my trip plan and also almost finished my packing. I will add my missing stuff during next week so I will be well prepared for this trip. Just hope I can make it next week!</p>

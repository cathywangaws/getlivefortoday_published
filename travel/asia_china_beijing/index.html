<p>The square is the geographic, political and tourist center of the city, which makes it unavoidable. When I came back from my hometown to Beijing by night train, I made a quick visit at Oct 30, 2019. It was about 8am but the square already drew in visitors with lots of guards. While strolling in Tiananmen Square which is the largest city square in the world today, I looked up at the magnificent layout, the majestic momentum, the vast and deep landscape. It invariably becomes a good memory.</p>

<p><img src="/image/Asia/China_Beijing_2019/04.jpg" alt="Beijing, China" title="Square of the Gate of Heavenly Peace - Beijing, China" /></p>

<p>There are two giant placards, the left one reading: “Long Live the People’s Republic of China” while the right one reading: “Long Live the Great Unity of the World’s Peoples.”</p>

<p>Tiananmen Square served as the gatehouse of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. The tower sits on the platform with five arch gateways. As the largest of the five, the center archway is used as the specific passage for Ming and Qing emperors while the side ones are smaller and employed as the passages for ministers and officials.</p>

<p>In front of the central arch gateway are two a pair of ornamental columns, called huabiao, which are carved with dragon design. On the top there is a plate called Cheng Lu Pan for collecting dew, and a crouching animal called Hou.</p>

<p>Outside the gate there are two lions. Lions are believed to protect humans from evil spirits in Chinese culture.</p>

<p>The Chinese name of the gate, Tiananmen, is made up of three Chinese characters “heaven”, “peace”, and “gate”, hence the translated version “The Gate of Heavenly Peace”.
Various roofs</p>

<p><img src="/image/Asia/China_Beijing_2019/11.jpg" alt="Beijing, China" title="Square of the Gate of Heavenly Peace - Beijing, China" /></p>

<p>The roofs are generally big, featured with the smooth lines, distinct eaves and delicate animal statues. In addition to providing shelter, the roof has a more important function to show its rank. Tiles on the roofs are mostly yellow. Only the residences of imperial children have green roofs. Also, the bigger the roof, the higher rank the palace has.</p>

<p>The bracket, using to bearing the weight of the roof, is also a vital and typical part in ancient Chinese architecture. These brackets in Forbidden City architectures were no longer used to support the house and absorb the effects of earthquakes, but only for decoration. When you stand under the eaves and look up, you can see a wide variety of brackets on the top of pillars or walls.</p>

<p>Colored wall</p>

<p><img src="/image/Asia/China_Beijing_2019/14.jpg" alt="Beijing, China" title="Square of the Gate of Heavenly Peace - Beijing, China" /></p>

<p>The paintings had a dual function: Utility, with the application of a protective layer of wood, and decorator. There are dragons and phoenixes on the buildings. Dragons are supposed to protect the Emperors and phoenixes are supposed to protect the empresses.</p>

<p>I am not sure since when visiting Beijing before going back to US becomes a tradition for me. In this trip the color red touched my heart that brings me good luck and good fortune!</p>

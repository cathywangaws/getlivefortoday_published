          <p>There is no better way to take in the foliage than adventuring outside! This year, Andy and I flew to Albany, NY and then drove about one and half hours to Catskills Mountains in New York State on October 12, 2019.

<p>We did the Catskills Mountains Scenic Drive. The roads are winding and surrounded by dense forest with gentle change in elevation. It is a perfect Fall destination.

<p>The heart of the Catskills Mountains hold opportunities for seeing fall foliage from the comfort of our car during a scenic drive. As we passed through the small towns and residents, we stopped and saw what special treats fall has brought to us.

<p>Timing is very important for a picture. When we saw the lake, it has a beautiful reflection. After we parked our car and walked down to the lake, it started windy and the surface of the lake had more and more waves that made the reflection going away.

<p>“Fall has always been my favorite season. The time when everything bursts with its last beauty, as if nature had been saving up all year for the grand finale.”

We saw a Tibetan temple at the top of a mountain in Catskills area. There were many colorful flags around the temple.

<p>Tremper Mountain Trail, Phoenicia NY</p>

<p>Address: 570 Mt Tremper-Phoenicia Rd, Phoenicia, NY</p>

<p>Start: 42.06601, – 74.30321
Distance: 5.9 miles
Route type: Out and Back
Rate: difficult</p>

<p>Average: 4 hours round trip</p>

<p>Mount Tremper Trail is a 5.9 mile moderately trafficked out and back trail located near Phoenicia, New York that features a river and is rated as difficult. The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from March until November.</p>

<p>“It has been reported that there are approximately 100 Timber Rattlesnakes that den at the old blue stone quarry on Mount Tremper.”</p>

<p>A red-blazed trail connects the parking area (10-car capacity) at County Route 40 (go east from Main Street in Phoenicia) to the Mount Tremper Fire Tower (2.75 miles, el. 2740 feet), gaining 2000 feet in elevation. The trail is a continuous climb on a rocky old road, going past the Baldwin Memorial Lean-to at 1.95 miles and a pipe spring at 2.05 miles (may be dry during periods of drought) before reaching the tower. The blue-blazed Warner Creek Trail to the yellow-blazed Willow Trail lead 3.65 miles from the fire tower to an undeveloped trailhead on Jessup Road (1,300-foot change in elevation).</p>

<p>Tremper Mountain, Shandaken Elevation 2,740 feet
This fire tower is believed to be the original structure built circa 1917, and used for fire observation until 1971. The 47-foot tower was placed in its present location because of the vast sections of forest preserve not visible from either the Hunter or Belleayre fire towers.
Directions: Follow the red-marked Phoenicia Trail located on Ulster County Route 40 just outside of Phoenicia-a moderate to difficult, six-mile, round-trip hike.</p>

<p>Overlook Mountain Trail, Woodstock NY</p>

<p>Address: 335 Meads Mountain Road, Woodstock, NY 12498
Distance: 4.6 miles
Route type: out and back</p>

<p>Distance: 9.34 miles round trip from DEC parking lot to Fire Town on Overlook Mtn Peak to Echo Lake and back to the parking lot. This hike can be reduced to 4.82 miles by skipping Echo Lake and the Ledges. 5.00 miles if you include the ledges and skip Echo Lake.
Time: Average 7.0 hours round trip</p>

A day trip to Miami, FL. Left home at 4am in the morning and back home at 10pm in the evening. Was at Miami about 4 hours but it was a surprised and unplanned trip! The flight was already full. I didn’t think I could have a chance! The departure time was at 7:10am and we got assigned seats at 7am. It was really a surprise. The sky was still dark at 7am.">

<p>A day trip to Miami, FL. Left home at 4am in the morning and back home at 10pm in the evening. Was at Miami about 4 hours but it was a surprised and unplanned trip!
The flight was already full. I didn’t think I could have a chance!
The departure time was at 7:10am and we got assigned seats at 7am. It was really a surprise.
The sky was still dark at 7am.</p>

<p>Above Miami, FL. This was my first time to land at Miami airport.
After arrived at South Miami Beach, first thing was coffee at Starbucks.
We were here at about 12:30pm so we needed lunch first. I had a drink first.</p>

<p>Deep fried calamari. It was good with my drink.
I had shrimp salad. Shrimp is very fresh and my lunch was light.
Seafood pasta.
There were fruit booths to sell local fresh cut fruits. The papaya was really large size that I never saw this size in a store.
The temperature was about 70ish. So the weather was very pleasant.
The water wasn’t cold so I could play on the beach.
The sky, the wind, the wave, and me!
My orange hat with my black outfit.
Picked few seashells from the Ocean.
I was here couple of year ago so I can still remember this kind of booth.
It was sunset after reached the MIA airport. I was at Miami from sunrise to sunset. What a beautiful day!
Enjoy champion in the flight.
Sit back, relax, cheese cake, and watch a movie in the flight.
Chicago night landscape.
This backpack caught my interest so I took a picture of it.</p>

Group of four to Memphis, Tennessee. This sounds unusual to me. The flight to MEM was wide open so Dan and his girlfriend also want to visit Memphis. All of us had never been to Memphis yet. So we decided to explore the city together.
Before we made the decision to go together, I sent them my itinerary to checkif they can follow my schedule.">

<p>Group of four to Memphis, Tennessee. This sounds unusual to me. The flight to MEM was wide open so Dan and his girlfriend also want to visit Memphis. All of us had never been to Memphis yet. So we decided to explore the city together.</p>

<p>Before we made the decision to go together, I sent them my itinerary to checkif they can follow my schedule. If they couldn’t, I would suggest them to be on their own. However, they were flexible enough and they didn’t have issues to follow my plans.</p>

<p>Dan and I went to airport by CTA blue line train. Andy and Weining drove to the airport individually. Four of us met at Terminal 1 at 6pm.</p>

<p>Dan and I left from work at 3:30 so we had some time to have a drink at Jackson Taverns restaurant that is just across the Willis Tower. We ordered a big jar of seasonal beer. Just for fun, I took pictures before and after drinking so it looked like I finished the whole jar by myself. Actually, I just had about half glass of beer.</p>

<p>Then we hopped on blue line subway to the O’Hare airport. When we almost reach the Damen train station, Dan told me this is his old neighborhood 20 years ago and wanted to stopped by to take a look. Since we still had time to the airport, we hopped off the train and  had a drink at a Mexican style restaurant. The weather was very pleasant, wasn’t hot, humid, or cold. Many people sit outside for drinks and food and so did we.</p>

<p>We arrived at the airport at 6pm and Andy was already there waiting. We passed the TSA after Weining show up. The flight departure time was at 7:40pm. We got assigned seats before onboarding. We were going to Memphis! We also got time to book the hotel before the flight departure. We checked in the hotel at 10:25pm after Uber dropped us at front of the hotel.</p>

<p>Beale Street</p>

<p>Memphis is a night life city. After we took a short break in our rooms, we headed to Beale St because it is listed on the US National Landmark District list.</p>

<p>There were many people were in that area. There were also many policemen over there. Today, this street has many blues clubs and restaurants line the street. After the policemen checked our IDs and scanned our bodies, we were allowed to enter the Beale St. This street is only about 2 blocks but it is allowed to drink on the street. So people may get tipsy. We need to be careful. We strolled on the Beale Street where is the birthplace of Rock n Roll. This street is one of most popular places in this city, especially at night.</p>

<p>Beale street has played a major role in the city of Memphis, Tennessee. It became a place where Black American freedman started their lives in the city. During the 1920s, Beale Street turned into an entertainment and business district.</p>

<p>Personally, I like slow music. Sometimes, I like blues but I am not fan of Rock and Rolls. However, I am interested to visit this unique place once in my life time. I like explore cities to learn history and culture.</p>

<p>People held a drink in their hands, stood on the street, and chatted together. Small booths along the street sale all kind of drinks. I had a beer in my hand. It was a good drink for such hot summer night. It cooled me down.</p>

<p>After we strolled from one end of Beale Street to another end, we went to Blues City Café for late dinner. We had full slab of seasoning rib with fries. The ribs tasted so delicious and bone-off. It hit the spot!</p>

<p>This restaurant was founded in 1991, it has hosted musical guests such as BB King, Jerry Lee Lewis, Al Green etc. That is why this restaurant is a famous place for meals.</p>

<p>We walked back to the hotel at 12:30 midnight. I knew it was late and I needed to get up early for a morning run. Sometime, visiting a city in a short time have to scarify sleeping hours. I decided to get up at 6am so I had less than 5 hours sleep. The bed was so cozy but I didn’t have time to sleep on it. It is okay for me since I prefer to sleep in my own bed at home to catch up my missed sleep hours.</p>

<p>Big River Crossing</p>

<p>This is my highlight of this trip. Running on the bridge and crossing 2 states, Arkansas and Tennessee. I had never been to these 2 states yet and this trip could make it happen just in a minute. I was so excited about this morning exercise. The bridge opens at 6am in morning. The total running from my hotel to AK state was 6.33 miles. This bridge is the longest public pedestrian bridge across the Mississippi river. I didn’t see many early birds on the bridge. Maybe because the temperature was already too hot and humid. I was so sweaty when I ran but I didn’t give it up. I had to finish this trail.</p>

<p>We had breakfast at TGI Friday restaurant at 9am. I checked the flight during breakfast. I saw the flight looked pretty full and a group of 4 standby people ahead of me. These made me nervous because I wanted to go home at Saturday instead of Sunday morning. I didn’t want to get too much pressure about the flight so I bought 2 tickets by using my United Miles, 10k per person that wasn’t bad at all and guaranteed to get on the flight.</p>

<p>I had fresh cooked omelet with cheese. I always like eggs so this omelet is perfect to me for a breakfast. I also drank two glasses of orange juice. I need to keep hydrated after morning run.</p>

<p>Memphis was very quiet at Saturday morning. I barely to see any people on streets. It just looks like an empty city.</p>

<p>Rock n Soul Museum</p>

<p>I learned the history of rock music and soul music, and how the two styles of music joined together to create rock-and-roll.</p>

<p>Gus’s Fried Chicken is a famous place for chicken. We decided to have some snacks after visiting the museum at about 11:30am. It wasn’t crowded yet so we got a table right away. I had 3 piece dark meal. The chicken was very crispy with little spicy flavor. It was a good choice to give it a try.</p>

<p>Old Dominick Distillery</p>

<p>We saw Old Dominick Distillery across this chick place. Dan makes his own beer and wine so he is interested to visiting any distillery. Even though this wasn’t on my to do list but we still had more time to take a distillery tour at 12 noon and the tour took about 45 mins and it had tasting in their bar at the end of the tour.</p>

<p>Oak barrel. This was my first time I saw what it looked like inside. It was burned by charcoal so the color was black. This is how the spirits get oak flavor.</p>

<p>Sun Studio</p>

<p>This is another place that I wanted to visit most in this trip. Elvis Presley started his music career here. I like one of his songs, Love Me Tender. I could listen to it hundreds times without feeling bored. It is a small studio but full with visitors inside. Obviously, it is a very popular place to stop by. We joined the tour and the tour girl gave us great tour. These stories were so touched about rock and roll.</p>

<p>This microphone was used by Elvis and it was allowed us to touch it and play with it. I was trying to be a rock and roll star LOL.</p>

<p>This was our last stop on my to do list. We took Uber back to the airport for the 6pm flight.</p>

<p>We all had great time.</p>

<p>行程的亮点是意外的去了及坚持参观了大名鼎鼎的太阳音乐工作室 – 据说这是真正的摇滚乐的发源地……1954年七月的一个晚上，一个叫ElvisPresley的青年在录制过程中，开始用《That’sAllRight》打发时间，这是一首布鲁斯歌曲，是黑人吉他歌手ArthurCrudup创作的。Phillips 起先并不太在意，但突然之间似乎天窗洞开，将这首仅由三件乐器伴奏的歌曲推荐给了孟菲斯电台。《That’sAllRight》作为主打歌于7月19号推出，这首歌曲随即成就了一场音乐、文化和种族融合的革命，这是一次全新的布鲁斯与乡村音乐的美妙接触，新乐曲调轻快、热烈甚至带着一股狂野之风。不过最主要的是这支曲子就像信使传遍了整个世界，宣告在孟菲斯诞生了一种新的音乐形式——摇滚。这个叫ElvisPresley的人更是因为其伟大的个人魅力成为摇滚乐之王，而这个SamPhillips也因此被称为“摇滚乐之父”……</p>

<p>RUN WHILE TRAVELING</p>

<p>From now on, I will bring my running shoes with me when I travel. Running is a great workout. It is not only for body but for mind. So I ran when I traveled to DC this time and feeling was great.</p>

<p>Bought one-way ticket to Washington DC today. Didn‚Äôt get time to do travel research until last night. DC has many museums and history. I am not sure if I will have time to visit them in one day. So far, I plan to go to Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM) and Renwick Gallery. I will also bring my running shoes with me ‚Äì RUNNING WHILE TRAVELING. This will be the highlight in this trip!</p>

<p>DCA (Reagan National Airport)</p>

<p>Terminals B/C are directly connected to the Metro station, from Terminal A it is a short walk through the connecting hallway.</p>

<p>The Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport is on the Blue and Yellow lines. You can take either line into downtown DC but if you‚Äôre headed downtown, the yellow line is usually faster.</p>

<p>The airport building looks like a museum. The floor shinny like a mirror.</p>

<p>Hilton Crystal City at Washington Reagan National Airport
Address: 2399 Jefferson Davis Hwy, Arlington, VA 22202</p>

<p>Hotel offers complimentary shuttle service to Reagan National Airport. Follow signs for Rt. 1 North (Jefferson Davis Highway). Make right at first light on Jefferson Davis Highway. Hotel is on right. Distance from Hotel: 1 mi.</p>

<p>L‚ÄôEnfant Plaza Metro Station
Address: 600 Maryland Avenue SW Washington, DC 20024</p>

<p>Crystal City Station (to Fort Totten)
Address: 1750 S Bell St, Arlington, VA 22202</p>

<p>Yellow: runs north-south. The yellow line shares a track with Green for most of downtown. Both lines visit L‚ÄôEnfant Plaza but Yellow continues south to Virginia for Pentagon, National Airport and King Street for Old Town Alexandria.
Purchase SmarTrip¬Æ Card at any Metrorail station. They cost $10/each, but they come preloaded with $8 of credit. SmartTrip cards can only be purchased from SmartTrip card vending machines. Operating 7 am ‚Äì 11 pm on weekends (8 am on Sunday)</p>

<p>Pay-As-You-Go Fares</p>

<p>One way to travel is by paying as you go.  There is no set fare for all trips. Fares between stations depends on distance as well as the time of day.</p>

<p>Each vending machine will show you what it costs to go to any station in the system.</p>

<p>For trips within the urban core that ends up being about $3/trip during peak rush and about $2/trip during off-peak hours for a full fare trip.</p>

<p>Keep your SmarTrip card handy, even after you tap in at a fare gate. In many cities, you only have to tap into the system, but in DC you also have to tap out of the system. The fare gates have a circular target on top to touch your card. When the gate reads your card, the gate opens.</p>

<p>You‚Äôll repeat the process on the way out, but keep an eye on the gate as you exit where a small digital display on the gate will update the cash remaining on your card.</p>

<p>Everyone in your party must have their own Smartrip card.  More than one person cannot use the same Smartrip at the same time.</p>

<p>National Mall</p>

<p>Art + Artists</p>

<p>Smithsonian American Art Museum</p>

<p>The Smithsonian American Art Museum is a museum in Washington, D.C., part of the Smithsonian Institution. Together with its branch museum, the Renwick Gallery, SAAM holds one of the world‚Äôs largest and most inclusive collections of art, from the colonial period to the present, made in the United States.</p>

<p>Two historic locations</p>

<p>The Smithsonian American Art Museum shares its collections, programs, and exhibitions in two locations in Washington, DC. SAAM‚Äôs main building is located at the heart of a vibrant downtown cultural district, while its recently renovated branch museum for contemporary craft and decorative art, the Renwick Gallery, is located nine blocks west, near the White House.</p>

<p>Smithsonian American Art Museum
Address: 8th and F Streets, NW, Washington, DC 20004
Open Daily 11:30 a.m.‚Äì7:00 p.m</p>

<p>SAAM is located at Eighth and F streets N.W., above the Gallery Place/Chinatown Metrorail station and is accessible from Green, Yellow, and Red metro lines. At SAAM, ramps are located on both sides of the 8th and G Streets NW entrance.</p>

<p>Smithsonian American Art Museum Highlights Tour
Saturday, September 22, 2018, 12:30 ‚Äì 1:30pm or 2 ‚Äì 3pm
Event Location: Meet in the F Street Lobby
Cost: Free; walk-in</p>

<p>Renwick Gallery
Address: Pennsylvania Avenue at 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20006
Open Daily 10:00 a.m.‚Äì5:30 p.m</p>

<p>The Renwick Gallery is located steps from the White House in the heart of historic federal Washington. The closest Metro stations are Farragut West (Blue, Orange, and Silver lines) and Farragut North (Red line). Barrier-free ramp access is available at the 17th Street entrance.</p>

<p>Captain White‚Äôs Seafood
Address: 1100 Maine Ave SW. Washington DC 20024
Hours: Saturday 7:30am ‚Äì 9pm</p>

<p>This is my favorite place in DC because it has same day caught seafood. This market is actually on the floating docking. All fresh fishes, shrimps, oysters, crabs etc are lined up on the table. You can buy lived crabs and can get steamed right away. Steaming just take about 18 mins. You don‚Äôt have to pay but don‚Äôt forget to tip!</p>

<p>This place is not too far from National Mall. You definitely can walk to over there. They have a place for carry out customers to eat with waterfront view.</p>

<p>Steamed live crabs with old bay seasoning. So sweet!</p>

<p>Crawfish</p>

<p>Jumbo Shrimps with old bay seasoning</p>

<p>In the evening, went back to National Mall again since wanted to take some night landscape pictures. It wasn‚Äôt that crowded in the evening. All lights were on so the buildings look prettier than day light.</p>

<p>Sunday 9/23/2018</p>

<p>It was a rainy day in DC so went to the hotel gym for a little workout.</p>

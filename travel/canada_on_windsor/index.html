<p>Canada was the first foreign country where I went abroad. I dealt with a new language, new way of thinking, new culture, which opened my eyes and changed my perspective of life completely.</p>

<p><img src="/image/Canada/Ontario_Windsor/Windsor02.jpeg" alt="Windsor, Ontario Canada" title="O Canada – Visiting Windsor, Ontario Canada" /></p>

<p>Windsor, Ontario Canada is the place actually changed me. I consider it as my second hometown because not only I got my CS degree but my mom is living there. Windsor means a lot to me. So no matter where I am and how busy I am, I visit Windsor very often.</p>

<p><img src="/image/Canada/Ontario_Windsor/Windsor03.png" alt="Windsor, Ontario Canada" title="O Canada – Visiting Windsor, Ontario Canada" /></p>

<p>Windsor is an interesting urban curiosity for those who want to see a small multicultural town. There is a southernmost university, University of Windsor. There is a small Chinatown. There is a great Lebanese food. There is a fantastic views of riverfront park. There is a unparalleled waterfront park stretches about 5 kilometers. There is Caesars Windsor – a casino complex overlooking Detroit.</p>

<p>The riverfront park is the most popular place in Windsor, ON. During sunset time, many people came out, walked around, and looked over another side of Detroit river. What a relaxing moment to me!</p>

<p>If you dig deeper, you also can find fascinating history here. Windsor became an important center of whiskey production and, thus, a major smuggling port during Prohibition.

Windsor is International Gateway between Canada and the United States of America. It is across the Detroit River from the U.S. city of Detroit, MI.

In the city of Windsor, 27.8 percent of the population were immigrants, and 4.3 percent of them had settled between 2011 and 2016. Where did people come from? The largest group came from Iraq, representing 20.2 percent of recent immigrants. The second largest group were from Syria, at 10.5 percent. In third place was the United States, making up 8.6 percent of recent immigrants. China and India tied for fourth place, both representing 7.9 percent of the population.</p>

<p>Windsor has a low violent crime rate and one of the lowest murder rates in Canada. Each summer, Windsor co-hosts the two-week-long Windsor-Detroit International Freedom Festival, which culminates in a gigantic fireworks display that celebrates Canada Day and the Fourth of July.</p>

<p><strong>2019/05/25</strong></p>

<p>This weekend is still spring break. I didn’t think We could standby to Detroit since the flight looked very full. We waited for 9:45pm flight and 4 standbys got on the flight. We were lucky since we didn’t have to drive at dark night for about 5 to 6 hours that relief our stress for this trip. We arrived Windsor, ON at 1am at Saturday.</p>

<p>We picked up this rental car from Hertz that has only 7 miles. It is so new so good when you sit in and drive!</p>

<p>As our tradition, we went to Tim Horton for our breakfast. The weather was so beautiful this Saturday. My mom doesn’t like bitter coffee so I ordered latte for her. She likes croissant sandwich and I like strawberry cheese muffin.</p>

<p>We ran some errands after breakfast. Windsor is a small city. You can drive about 30 minutes from east end to west end. Even the city is small, but it has everything you need like many grocery stores that include a big Chinese grocery store, middle east grocery stores, farmers market etc , a shopping mall, banks, train station, airport, and our favorite store: Costco.</p>

<p>Across Detroit River from Windsor, you can see General Motor Headquarter where located in Detroit downtown.</p>

<p>We picked up one of my mom’s friends who is a acupuncture doctor for lunch together. She is good at to release patients pain by using traditional acupuncture and she is giving my mom treatment for her back pain. She gives my mom a lot of help from all aspect other than treatment. I really appreciate her help. A lunch is not enough to express my appreciation.</p>

<p>We all took a nap after went back home at about 3pm. That gave us more energy. After dinner we played the Chinese Mia Jiang together until 11pm. A long day but a happy day. Spent time with my mom to make her happier.</p>

<p><strong>2019-02-26</strong></p>

<p>The weather is not pleasant in this winter. It had lot of snow, cold, and windy. These made my travel more difficult. I was supposed to visit my mom before Chinese New Year that was 2/5/2019. I was waiting for a better weather but it seemed got worse on weekends. I couldn’t wait longer to see my mom so we drove to Windsor last weekend. The road conditions were not bad at all except strong wind on the way back home. Each way took about 5 hours by driving.</p>

<p>The forecast said 70 percent of chance rain but it was just cloudy at Saturday. So we could go out for errands. That made us happier!</p>

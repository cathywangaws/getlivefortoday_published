With high and low tides.

When we go near it,
We feel that we are in paradise!

The warmth of the sand touching the feet,
The feel of the breeze with a welcoming greet.

The sight of the people playing on the shore,
Makes my heart roar likes never before!

Time flew by as I tried explorer,
The beautiful treasures yet the sea bore.

Feeling satisfied we flew home,
With memories to cherish forever more!

A Poem by Suneethi Jerushia 
</code></pre>

<p>This week is our wedding anniversary. I wanted to go somewhere to celebrate it. My original plan was Niagara Falls, Canada but the weather wasn’t corporate. I would like to go somewhere warm and sunny for this special event. At the last minute, we went to Los Angeles, California.</p>

<p>At Saturday morning, September 14, 2019, we checked out The Westin hotel and headed to Santa Monica beach, California. We were relatively early on the beach because we always like the crispy morning air and low crowds.</p>

<p>The blue sky was brilliant against the white waves. Warm sun from the sunny summer sky beat down on my exposed legs. At the moments like this, nothing could be better.</p>

<p>Dashing into the waves We soaked into the cool water. Walking along the beach, searching for seashells.</p>

<p>This was qualified to be a perfectly awesome summer day!</p>

<p>9/14/2019 AN EXPENSIVE TRIP</p>

<p>Expensive is not same as luxury. Last Friday 9/13/2019, we flew to LAX after work. We checked in The Westin Hotel which is a 4-star hotel at midnight. In my mind, a 4-star hotel must be very cozy and elegant. As soon as we opened the room door, I got disappointed. The room just looked like a regular 3-star hotel room that is nothing is special. The carpet is gray which looks like pretty old. The king size bed has regular white bed sheet and pillows. The bathroom has only 3 bath towels which the quality is just so so. However, the room rate is not cheap and parking is $45 per night plus tax.</p>

<p>Next day, we wasn’t in rush so we checked out the hotel at 8am. Synonymous with L.A. in many a mind is the county’s beautiful beaches. I originally planned to go to Santa Barbara beach which is about 2 hours away from LA. When we drove into Malibu county, the roads were changed to single lane. There was bike race today. So we realized that it would be heavy traffic in the afternoon. We didn’t want to get stuck on the road and miss our red-eye flight at night so we changed our plan to go to Santa Monica beach instead.</p>

<p>Along the way, there were volleyball players, swimmers, and beachcombers enjoying the sun. We parked our car along the road.</p>

<p>This is a 2019 model Ford Fusion Hybrid car. The car doesn’t have a shift gear. It is just a round button. Technology is changing in our life so fast.</p>

<p>The temperature was about 80F and I felt like 90F under exposed sun. I got so sweaty on the beach and ocean water is chill. When we arrived the Santa Monica beach, there were only about 3 couples. We started some photo shooting and played with water and waves. Soon, more and more people showed up. The beach became crowded. A girl was even offer to take photos for us. She took a bunch of romantic pictures for us. What is nice and friendly girl. We probably just stayed on the beach for 2 hours since we didn’t want to get sunburned. So I fulfilled my trip plan – 2 hours on the beach from Chicago to Los Angeles which Andy was teasing me that this was an expensive trip ever!</p>

<p>We have visited LA many times and visited most of popular attractions. So we didn’t have too much things to do in this trip except playing by the deep blue sea!</p>

<p>It was about noon, so we decided to eat some Chinese food. There is a Chinatown about 45 minutes away from Santa Monica. L.A. is a traffic city. No matter what time you are on the road, the traffic is jammed all the time which we don’t like it very much.</p>

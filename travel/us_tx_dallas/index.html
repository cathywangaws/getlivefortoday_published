          <p>A short trip to Dallas, TX. This was my 2nd time to land at DFW airport. A couple of years ago, I was here for a Microsoft Ignite Training where was located in Irving, TX. I did some travel research about Dallas but it seems a little boring city for me because I was looking for some outdoor activities. However, Dallas is a very flat area without mountains. I wasn’t able to find things that I really wanted to explore. Finally, I decide to just visit the downtown area since I had never been here yet. Need to check this city out from my bucket list!</p>

<p><img src="/image/US/TX/Dallas01.jpg" alt="Dallas, Texas" title="Dallas, Texas" /></p>

<p>Chicago just had a big winter storm with lot of snows for two days. This weekend was better to go somewhere warmer. Dallas was about 60F degree and flights were wide open. We landed at DFW airport at 8:30pm. When I booked the hotel, it show the shuttle bus icon on Hilton app. So I assume the hotel would pick us up at DFW terminal. We also called the front desk before taking off the flight, and the front desk told us the shuttle ran every 30 minutes. As soon as I got this information, I cancelled my rental reservation. It takes about 30 minutes from DFW airport to Dallas downtown. I was surprised that the hotel provided the free shuttle. We waited for about 20 minutes at the DFW terminal and saw other hotel vehicles but not seeing our hotel vehicle at all. So I decided to call the front desk again to check the schedule. The front desk lady said they have shuttle to Dallas Love Field Airport (DAL) , not Dallas-‐Fort Worth Airport (DFW). So we had to figure out our own transportation. It was already 9pm so we decide to order a Uber. The Uber came just in 5 minutes that was quick. When we got on the Uber, the driver started to talk with us. After awhile, he said the GPS seems taking him in a loop without going to downtown. So the driver asked me to open my Google Map to pilot him. I was so surprised. As a Uber driver, he is supposed to know the routes. We wasted about 20 minutes to figure out the right direction so the 30 minutes trip took 50 minutes to arrive at my hotel. That sucks!</p>

<p>When the Uber drove into the downtown area, we saw homeless people on streets and policemen were everywhere. We knew this is not a safe city! We bought drink and food from Royal Blue Grocery for our late dinner so we could eat them in our hotel room. It was 10:45pm already. It wouldn’t be safe to go to a restaurant at this time!</p>

<p>Next day, we headed out at 7am after the hot breakfast. I used the Google Map to check out my points of interest one at a time. In 3 hours, we finished the To Do List. I wasn’t a museum person so we just explore the city and focus on architecture. Overall, the city is clean and less people in the early morning. Again policemen were everywhere in the morning too. So I felt it was good and bad. Good is for the safety and Bad is for safety too.</p>

<p>Scooters are everywhere in the city and it says $1/hour. Must be a popular transportation in Dallas. I prefer running or jogging when I visit a city. This way we can do more exercise.</p>

<p>The Uber charged us $50 bucks that was expensive than the original order. It said $32 when I ordered the Uber at the airport. Because the driver lost the directions, so we had to pay more!</p>

<p>After 3 hours visiting, we had nothing else on our list so we decided to go back to the airport by DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) that took 1 hour from downtown to the airport. The transit was very clean and I could look outside to see the suburbs of Dallas that I liked it!</p>

<p>We had enough time to wait for the flight so we tasted Texas BBQ and also found this hot jalapeño pretzel. I didn’t see it in other cities:)</p>

<p>Dallas city has some arts. They look interesting and beautiful.</p>

<p>The weather is mild in winter so people still can sit outside and enjoy a drink or a meal.</p>

<p>The trip was over that made me happy! Cathy finished her first adventure in year 2019!</p>

<p>A Running experience to remember!</p>

<p>Bright lights, big personalities, shiny cars… In many ways, Dallas is the belle of the Texas ball. From JR Ewing and the TV show Dallas to the Dallas Cowboys and their cheerleaders, this city has made a deep imprint on American popular culture. An upscale ethos makes for an amazing dining scene (you can tell which place is hot by the caliber of cars the valet parks out front). The museums are not only excellent, but unique – history buff s should not miss the memorials to former president John F Kennedy. And one of the most impressive additions to Dallas’ cultural landscape in recent years is the 68-acre Arts District, now one of the largest in the country</p>

<p>Whether you’re a history buff , an art lover or a cowboy at heart, Dallas has something for you. The city offers a heady mix of world-class art museums, fascinating JFK-related attractions and vibrant neighborhoods. Throw in nearby Fort Worth’s Old West–style Stockyards and it all seems downright unfair to its Texas rivals
Highlights:</p>

<p>JFK</p>

<p>The president’s legacy is a palpable part of the visitor experience here. The sites associated with his death are among Dallas’ most visited attrac-tions. Make a pilgrimage to the thought-provoking Sixth Floor Museum, the nearby monu-ments and Dealey Plaza</p>

<p>TEXAS BARBECUE</p>

<p>No bones about it: Texas barbecue is an obsession. Line up with the hordes for large helpings of slow-cooked beef brisket, pork ribs and spicy sausage doused in spicy-sweet barbecue sauce at some of the city’s best, including Sammy’s BBQ and Pecan Lodge.</p>

<p>ART MUSEUMS</p>

<p>Dallas’ art scene packs a world-class punch, from the Dallas Museum of Art’s international exhibits to the Meadows Museum’s Spanish masterpieces. The Arts District and its top-notch museums could occupy you for days</p>

<p>GREEN SPACES</p>

<p>Klyde Warren Park is an urban green space across from the Arts District that features areas for chess, yoga and other activities. For more greenery, head to the gorgeous Dallas Arboretum and Botanical Garden, on the shores of White Rock Lake.</p>

<p>FORT WORTH STOCKYARDS</p>

<p>Real cowboys are in short supply in cosmopol-itan Dallas – but not over in Fort Worth, where you can rustle up some fun straight out of the Old West in this neighborhood of honky-tonks, rodeos and cattle drives</p>

<p>Real cowboys are in short supply in cosmopol-itan Dallas – but not over in Fort Worth, where you can rustle up some fun straight out of the Old West in this neighborhood of honky-tonks, rodeos and cattle drives</p>

<p>Neighborhood</p>

<p>Arts District
This is one of the largest arts districts in the nation, with 68 acres of arts, entertainment and culture. You’ll fi nd top-notch museums, music, theater and stunning modern architecture. The district is also rich in performing arts, hosting Dallas’ world-class opera, theater and dance.</p>

<p>Bishop Arts Distrct
Merging hipster and funky, this small neighborhood of boho-style shops and trendy bars and restau-rants is good for strolling. Walk off our meal by window-shopping the
idiosyncratic boutiques.</p>

<p>Deep Ellum
‘Deep’ up Elm St gets its name from the Texas-drawl pronunciation of ‘Elm.’ No matter how you say it, this neighborhood of low-lying ware-houses just east of Downtown is dive-bar-and-live-music central. It’s also the city’s edgiest neighborhood; colorful street art and performers make for great photo opportunities</p>

<p>Design District
Tech and design fi rms, antique shops, galleries, condos and a few restaurants and bars are joining the high-end interior design showrooms, all in an area of mostly low-rise buildings only two miles northwest of Downtown.</p>

<p>Downtown
Downtown is the epicenter of Dallas’ history, with museums that both commemorate and celebrate. It’s also growing into a live/work community, with scores of apart-ment buildings popping up.</p>

<p>Greenville Avenue
This East Dallas neighborhood is a growing stretch of bars and restau-rants, most with outdoor patios, lining the eponymous avenue. One highlight is the historic Granada Theater, often praised as the best live-music venue in town.</p>

<p>Highland Park
One of the wealthiest residential areas in the US, this is Dallas’ version of Beverly Hills, where Jimmy Choo–wearing ladies who lunch drive Jaguars to Spanish Mission–style Highland Park Village. The George W Bush Presidential Library &amp; Museum is housed at nearby Southern Methodist University.</p>

<p>Knox/Henderson
This pedestrian-friendly area is named for the two primary roads that connect over the US-75 highway. On the west side, Knox is larger, with more high-end shops (including an Apple store). On the Henderson side you’ll fi nd antiques and retro fashions.</p>

<p>Uptown &amp; Harwood
McKinney Ave is the main thor-oughfare of this trendy, rapidly expanding upscale area just north of Downtown. High-rise residential and offi ce buildings mean there’s foot traffi c day and night and a wide range of eating and drinking places to satisfy every taste and budget.</p>

<p>West End
Located in the northwest corridor of Downtown Dallas, the West End Historic District is where you’ll fi nd attractions like the Sixth Floor Museum and authentic shops like Wild Bill’s Western Store. The several blocks of rehabbed brick warehouses host a selection of restaurants and bars, convenient for those staying nearby.</p>

<p>West Village
On the northern end of Uptown (at Lemmon and McKinney Aves), the West Village neighborhood is one of Dallas’ most popular shopping districts. It has a distinctly SoCal vibe, with a vast collection of high-end stores and one-off boutiques.</p>

<p>Dallas Architecture</p>

<p>The Dallas skyline has long been one of the most vibrant in the US, and it’s getting more interesting all the time. Some buildings to look out for include the following:</p>

<p>Magnolia Petroleum Company Building
The red-neon Pegasus became a symbol of ‘allas when it À rst fl ew atop this building in 1934. ,t isappeared for decades before re-emerging atop the newly renovated building, now a hotel, in 1999.</p>

<p>Bank of America Plaza
One of the tallest buildings in Texas, this modernist skyscraper is outlined each night in LED lights, which plays well with all the other colored-by-night buildings Downtown.</p>

<p>Reunion Tower
The city’s unoffi cial architectural symbol rises 50 stories, topped off by a three-level spherical dome with 260 flashing lights. Its iconic observation deck off ers 360-degree views of the city.</p>

<p>Wyly Theatre
The vertically stacked 12-story structure broke the architectural mold by challenging traditional theater designs.</p>

<p>Sixth Floor Museum MUSEUM

Book Depository,
Address: 411 Elm St;
Fee: adult/child $<sup>16</sup>&frasl;<sub>13</sub>;
hours: 10am-6pm Tue-Sun, noon-6pm Mon;</p>

<p>Rather than downplay the assas-sination of John F Kennedy, Dallas gives visitors a unique opportunity to delve into the world-altering events that sent the country reeling in 1963. Fascinating multimedia exhibits inside the former Texas School Book Depository (plus the included audio guide) give an excellent historical context of the president’s time, as well as his life and legacy.</p>

<p>Pecan Lodge BARBECUE
www.pecanlodge.com;
Address: 2702 Main St;
hours: 11am-3pm Sun &amp; Tue-Thu, to 10pm Fri &amp; Sat
An icon in Deep Ellum, Pecan Lodge fires up mouthwatering brisket, ribs and pulled pork. Add the requisite sides (mac ‘n’ cheese, collard greens, plus peach cobbler for
dessert), local craft brews and you have one of Dallas’ best BBQ joints. Arrive early to score a shaded table on the patio</p>

<p>Tastes Born in Texas</p>

<p>Corn dogs</p>

<p>Cornbread-batter-dipped hot dogs on a stick were created in 1948 by Neil Fletcher for the State Fair of Texas; Fletcher’s still sells ‘em there. Now avail-able in jalapeño, too.</p>

<p>Shiner Bock
The state’s favorite amber ale came to be when Kosmos Spoetzl brought Bavarian brewing to Shiner, Texas, in 1914. Available countrywide, Shiner Bock is still brewed at Spoetzl Brewery.</p>

<p>Chicken-fried bacon
You may have heard of steak coated and deep-fried like chicken, but the taste (and heart-attack factor) was taken to new heights when Sodolak’s, in Somerville, started cooking bacon the same way in the early 1990s.</p>

<p>Frozen margaritas
Dallas restaurateur Mariano Martinez invented the frozen margarita machine in 1971 in an eff ort to keep up with demand for blended margaritas at his Tex-Mex grill, Mariano’s.</p>

<p>Dr Pepper
A pharmacist in a Waco drug store/soda shop invented this aromatic cola in the 1880s. It’s the oldest of the major-brand soft drinks in America</p>

<pre><code>Dallas is Texas’ most mythical city, with a past and present rich in the stuff that American legends are made of.

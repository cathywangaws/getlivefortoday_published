          <p>I gave myself a homework. I need to write a post on my blog after my each trip or adventure. I have came back from China for couple of days but my mind is not calm and I don’t know how to writ down this trip still. It is complicated. This trip mixed with some elements that I hadn’t been experienced yet!</p>

<p>A month ago before my vacation, I borrowed about 20 travel books from the library because I was planning to go to Africa or Europe. Morocco would be my first choice to see Sahara desert. Portugal would be my backup option to enjoy the summer sunshine. I made these two plans in a month. However, plans were changed dramatically at the last minute. We would go to China instead of Europe!</p>

<p>We need to look for a senior house at my hometown for my mom in China. There are more and more senior houses in China because seniors need more care. My second uncle lives in a big senior house in Beijing and he likes it very much so my mom gets his influence. We asked one of my cousins to take a look some senior houses at my hometown and he recommended 2 senior houses based on our criteria. One of Andy’s friends parents live in another big senior house. My mom knew another senior house. Totally we have about 4 senior houses that we would like to visit in this trip. I gave myself two days to visit them.

<p>Flying standby is not predictable until the day comes closer. The flight from Chicago to Beijing looked full so we went to San Francisco at Friday after work and layover for one night to fly to Beijing from SFO airport. We got Economy Premium Plus seats that are newly configured seats for United Airlines. The seat is little bigger and leg room is also bigger than economy seat. You can also rest your leg little better than economy seat. Food is between Business cabin and Economy cabin that makes feel funny. For 13 hours flight, you have to sit that is same as economy seat.

<p>We already bought train tickets from Beijing to my hometown via ctrip.com website. This is the website can accept credit card but you have to pick up your train tickets at the train station. We rode Airport Express train to Beijing city and then transferred to line 2 subway to head to the train station. Beijing was hot and humid without enough air conditioning. I was sweaty all the time. The train took 5 hours so we arrived at my hometown at Sunday midnight. My brother-in-law picked us up gratefully.</p>

<p>Monday was a busy day since I scheduled 2-3 senior houses to visit. Luckily, my brother-in-law had time for us so he could be our driver. First, we visit this senior house that is about 1 hour away from the city. It is a brand new place where located at suburb. There are about 5 buildings and all connected so seniors can do exercise in the wide hallway in all buildings in winter. The campus is still under construction. They will build a pond with walking path. We talked with few seniors but they complained about food. My consideration is it is too far from a big hospital and it is also difficult for people to visit her.</p>

<p>They gave us a tour and we also had lunch over there. Somehow, I felt this place is empty without many people. They were playing a Chinese chest game together. They told us there were about 100 seniors living here before but now it is only about 50 seniors. The number goes down that means some seniors don’t like here and moved out.</p>

<p>After we left here, we drove about 10 minutes for another senior house that is recommended by my mom. She visited this one couple of years ago and she said she likes here. It is a bigger campus with many buildings. The road in the campus is shared with vehicles that looks not safe for seniors who walk on the roads. I talked with one senior. He has been living here for one year. He was sitting at a banch and listening music.</p>

<p>We visited one of the buildings. The room looks old and not well maintained. Maybe it is because this place is one of oldest senior houses in my hometown. I am not sure how happy will be if a senior lives here. I don’t think I want my mom to live here.</p>

<p>Then we drove back to the city and visited another place that will be opened at the end of this year. It is a high raised building with more than 20 floors. The layout just like an apartment. There is no campus except building. I feel senior will get isolated here even though the room looks cozy but no society. Senior may feel lonely! So I would pass this one too. Also because it has not opened yet so I don’t know what kind of services they will provide and how many seniors will move in. My criteria is that a senior house must have more than 100 people with full service. They all claim they have full service but without seeing them, it is hard to believe.</p>

<p>I felt little upset after visiting these 3 places because I was not satisfied with them at all. They don’t match my criteria. I can’t let my mom live in such a place. I won’t get peaceful mind if she lives there.</p>

<p>Tuesday, we had one more to visit. Andy’s friend’s parents live here and they are also my mom’s college classmates. This senior house also has a website with information. Other senior houses don’t even have a website. So I did little research about this senior house and felt it looked good. Somehow, my mom didn’t have a smooth conversation with the sales guy over the WeChat so we thought they don’t have a warm heart. We got up very early at Tuesday because we wanted to visit Andy’s friend’s parents and meet the same sales guy.</p>

<p>It was a clear day with clouds at Tuesday. We arrived there at about 8:30am and saw seniors were doing morning exercises. I saw some seniors on campus. They got together to chat or walk around. Immediately, I started to like here. Also the campus looks very clean with wide road that only accessible by seniors.</p>

<p>We visited the rooms and also saw housekeepers were cleaning each apartment. We also chatted with some seniors and they all look happy without complaining. Some seniors already live there for couple of years. Also met a lady who lived in US for 40 years and then applied for Chinese green card to live in this place. Another couple came from another city who told us they lived two places but were not good as this one so they moved over here. All I got is positive feedback from people who live over there.</p>

<p>At the end, we talked with the sales guy. Actually, he is a young guy and doesn’t look cold. So we explained the situation about the initial conversation with my mom. That was a misunderstanding between them. I also bought him a bag of chocolate from the duty free store at the airport to show my appreciated to him. Andy and I all like this place so I put the deposit down and requested moving in October or November. I am very happy about this place. There are about 500 to 600 seniors living here now so it is a big senior house. They have all kind of services, even though each service needs extra cost. That is fair though. So the minimum start living price will be RMB4400 if pay 18 month in advance. Each apartment faces south and has furniture and a kitchen. Hope my mom will be happy to live here. Also the location is not far from the city with public transportation.</p>

<p>After finish all the visit in my hometown. We rode train back to Beijing at Wednesday morning. I would go to Gubei water town and climb the Great Wall.

<p>We stayed at Pearl Garden Hotel near long distance bus station in Beijing because we would go to the Great Wall next day. It is 2 hours trip with public transportation.</p>

<p>Gubei Water Town, China – row upon row of houses, old streets and long Hutong show the style and features of the old town. River channels are scattered between streets. When the night falls, the town presents a tranquil atmosphere.</p>

<p>We stayed at the best hotel in this town. It is a brand new five star hotel. Everything is super clean and cozy. I even had a bubble bath at night. The room also has a shower room. When you step out to the balcony, you can see the mountains and breath fresh air.</p>

<p>We took a nap in the hotel and then we explored the water town from sunset to dark. All snacks were so delicious. I totally forgot about my weight and ate everything I wanted.</p>

<p>It was a rainy day so there were not lot of people in the Great Wall. We decided to climb up the wall. This section of the Great Wall is less renovated. It looks more nature. The steps were not even. Some of them were very steep.</p>

<p>A Time-honored Watchtower – Simata Great Wall located at 120 km northeast of Beijing, holds the access to Gubeikou, a strategic pass in the eastern part of the Great Wall.</p>

<p>The water town looks more mystery after lights up.</p>

<p>Next day, we went back to the water town again. I had DIY for a small scarf that highlighted my trip too.</p>

<p>Another highlight is about this dyeing house coutyard.</p>

<p>After we went back to Beijing, we went to a popular instagram restaurant. We waited for 2 hours outside to get in for the dinner that was crazy.</p>

<p>Overall, this trip was successful. I did what I needed to do and also visited the places I planned. We flew back to home at Saturday so we had Sunday to adjust our jet lag at home and did lot of laundry. Home is always sweet home. No where is better than home!</p>

<p>San Antonio Missions National Historical Park is a National Historical Park and part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site preserving four of the five Spanish frontier missions in San Antonio, Texas, USA. These outposts were established by Catholic religious orders to spread Christianity among the local natives.</p>

<p>Getting Around: Quick Facts!</p>

<p>Four Missions.There are four missions in the National Park. From north to south: Mission Concepcion, Mission San José, Mission San Juan Capistrano, and Mission Espada. Each mission is about 2.5 miles from the next mission. It is very easy to drive from mission to mission, and parking is available at each mission site.</p>

<p>Along the River.</p>

<p>From the northernmost mission (Mission Concepcion) to the southernmost (Mission Espada) is about 6.5 miles. On an average day, it takes about 15 minutes to drive from the northernmost mission in the National Park to the southernmost. Each mission is situated near the San Antonio River, and are connected by Mission Rd.</p>

<p>Trails for Miles.</p>

<p>Approximately 10 miles of trail connects all four missions and extends north to The Alamo. The Hike &amp; Bike Trail is a pedestrian only path that follows the San Antonio River. Pedestrians walk and bike on the trail. B-Cycle stations are located at each mission site, and you may rent a bike for a 24 hour period for $12. Remember to dock your bike every 60 minutes when renting a B cycle. If you are planning on hitting the trail, always bring adequate supplies and water. Summer months can be extremely hot in San Antonio and not much of the Hike &amp; Bike Trail is shaded, so you should always carry water.</p>

<p>Bus Accessible.</p>

<p>The missions are accessible by VIA bus line 42 and VIVA bus line 40. Visit the linked webpages for more information.</p>

<p>The Alamo</p>

<p>The Alamo, originally called Mission San Antonio de Valero during the mission era, is the northernmost mission in San Antonio. The Alamo is not part of the San Antonio Missions National Historical Park boundary, but the site helps to complete the mission story in San Antonio.</p>

<p>Mission Concepcion</p>

<p>Mission Concepcion is the oldest unrestored stone church in America. The site is not only part of the National Park and UNESCO World Heritage Site, but is also a National Historic Landmark. Visit Mission Concepcion and you’ll see beautiful original fresco paintings and awe inspiring architecture which has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Mission San Jose</p>

<p>Mission San Jose is the largest mission in San Antonio. Mission San Jose was almost fully restored to its original design in the 1930s by the WPA (Works Projects Administration). While much of this mission is restored, this site gives visitors a more complete picture of the mission complex. Mission San Jose is complete with Indian Quarters, workshops, a convento, granary, church, and more. The park Visitor Center and bookstore are located at Mission San Jose. Catch a Ranger-led program or watch the park film at the Visitor Center!</p>

<p>Mission San Juan</p>

<p>Mission San Juan boasts beautiful grounds. At this site, visit our historic demonstration farm where the San Antonio Food Bank cultivates historical crops. Observe the over 300 year old acequia watering system at the San Juan farm. This mission also includes the Yanaguana Trail, which leads visitors on a short walk to an original segment of the San Antonio River.</p>

<p>Espada Aqueduct</p>

<p>Water was the most important resource to the mission inhabitants. Acequias, or irrigation ditches, brought water from the San Antonio River to the mission farm fields. The 18th century Espada Aqueduct carries acequia water over the low-level Six Mile Creek.</p>

<p>Mission Espada</p>

<p>Mission Espada was the first mission in Texas, established in 1690 as San Francisco de los Tejas near present-day Weches, Texas. Brick lined structures and woven arts make Mission Espada unique. Head to the southernmost mission to view this neighborhood gem.</p>

<p>Exploring San Antonio Beyond The Alamo</p>

<p>San Antonio is an incredibly romantic city. For one, every block features preserved Romanesque Revival and Neo-Gothic Revival architecture revamped for modern use, giving the entire destination a historic feel. Moreover, you’ll find boat rides, carriage tours, waterfront restaurants covered in hanging ivy with outdoor patios, brick-laced corridors and cobbled paths to hold hands down without even trying.</p>

<p>I respected the city’s rich history as a home to early Spanish colonial life and Texas’ first civilian settlement. San Antonio attractions like the Alamo and the many Missions — as well as historic cathedrals and basilicas — speak to this. And while one should certainly take the time to explore these sites, I wanted to go beyond the guidebook and explore lesser-known San Antonio.</p>

<p>San Antonio is proud of its history, including the culture that was left from all 6 countries that once claimed Texas as their own. The cultural influences of each of these countries left their mark on San Antonio’s cuisine and history. To truly understand what makes San Antonio tick, you must experience the history that built it.</p>

<p>Creative Heritage At The La Villita Historic Arts Village
I stumbled upon this gem while wandering the River Walk; and while upon first glance it may seem like a village created just for tourists, it’s exactly the opposite. After ascending a set of terraced steps reminiscent of a mini Machu Picchu, I entered a neat village lined with art galleries and handmade accessory shops. While each of the 25+ venues of the La Villita Historic Arts Village has its own focus — surreal pop art, Mexican handicrafts, mixed metal design, watercolor paintings, a unique fragrance factory — my favorite was B &amp; C Leather Designs &amp; Unique Finds and its individually crafted accessories.</p>

<p>Immerse Yourself In Mexican Culture At Historic Market Square
I actually didn’t visit Historic Market Square on purpose. I was checking out the small but lovely Milam Park — as well as the adjacent colorful and al fresco art adorned San Antonio Children’s Hospital — when I heard the sounds of Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias blasting nearby. I followed the upbeat music and came upon a square dating back to the 1820s, which locals dub “El Mercado,” full of vendor stalls, indoor shops and patio-equipped Latin eateries sitting underneath colorful strings of flags.</p>

Enchanted Rock State Natural Area</p>

<p>Address: 16710 Ranch Rd. 965, Fredericksburg, TX 78624</p>

<p>Magical, Mystical, Enchanted: Climb the ancient dome for amazing Hill Country views.The massive pink granite dome rising above Central Texas has drawn people for thousands of years. But there’s more at Enchanted Rock State Natural Area than just the dome. The scenery, rock formations and legends are magical, too!
Hiking</p>

<p>Explore nearly 11 miles of hiking trails. Take a virtual tour with our Interactive Trails Map. All trails close 30 minutes after sunset, except the Loop Trail. The Summit Trail may close in wet weather.</p>

<p>The Hikes: The path to the summit of Enchanted Rock is the most popular trail in Enchanted Rock State Natural Area and one of the more well known hikes in the state. The trail starts at the waypoint “Trailhead” on the topo map, near the turnaround at the northernmost parking area, and heads north. A restroom and water fountains are available nearby. Concrete steps make crossing Sandy Creek easy as the path leads up to the base of Enchanted Rock. On the large topo map Summit Trail is marked in red and other trails at Enchanted Rock are shown in blue.</p>

<p>Enchanted Rock is a known as a batholith – a large rounded dome of granite that formed as a pocket of magma under the surface of the Earth. Estimates place the occurrence of this formation at up to 1 billion years ago and the rock here is some of the oldest to be found in North America. Over time the surrounding limestone, a type of rock that more quickly erodes, began to weather away until the granite formation has finally begun to appear above the surface. Enchanted Rock is the second largest granite batholith in the United States, behind only Stone Mountain in Georgia.</p>

<p>As the path begins to ascend the rock it picks its way around a boulder field. The rocks here started life farther up the mountain. In a process of exfoliation these layers of rock that used to form the surface of the dome broke apart and slid down the new smooth underlying layer of rock and ended up here. Keep an eye open for trail markers uphill as sometimes it is difficult to differentiate the official path from other routes.</p>

<p>Near the waypoint “007” on the larger topo map, which is the intersection of the Echo Canyon Trail with the Summit Trail the boulder fields begin to thin out and the smooth surface of the dome begins to predominate. Large boulders that have “calved” off of the dome are still to be found on the slopes, seemingly still but actually moving in geological time downhill.</p>

<p>The trail on the dome is occasionally steep and can be slippery when wet. It also makes for a great stairmaster workout replacement. Once you’ve reached the smooth dome surface trail signs become moot. Just head uphill in whichever direction you prefer. A short ridge of rock provides the only obstacle. Just pick which way you’d rather go around it.</p>

<p>Near the summit you’ll see more and more shallow depressions in the granite. These formations are called vernal pools. The larger ones may still contain standing water well after a rain. More interesting are the pools that over time accumulate plant debris and soil. Eventually a small plant community will take hold on a permanent basis, providing a small oasis of life on the the face of solid rock. One of the larger communities near the summit even supports a small tree.</p>

<p>The summit is not a peak, but merely the highest point of the dome of rock. From the top the mountain slopes off gently in all directions, offering 360 degree views of the surrounding terrain. The winds can be gusty at the top and it certainly was when I visited. Even with a chin strap I ended up stowing my hat in my backpack to keep it from flapping about and being ripped from my head.</p>

<p>If the weather’s nice people will tend to congregate at the top. Because there’s no single peak to serve as a choke point, it’s possible to work your way around the perimeter of the top of the dome to find a spot far enough away from everyone else to find some peace, have lunch or take a nap.</p>

<p>The trail backtracks to the trailhead to complete the journey. Though solitude is not a feature of the Summit Trail it does provide a nice climbing workout and great views from the top of the mountain. No wonder it’s one of the best known hikes in Texas.</p>

<p>Once you round the bend on the way in and the vista opens up to this huge pink granite rock jutting out of the valley floor, you know you’ve reached a place that holds spiritual power.</p>

<p>This was once known to be a magical place for the local Apache and Comanche tribes.</p>

<pre><code>One thing to be aware of is that Enchanted Rock State Natural Area has limited parking space. Once it is full, they close down the park.
</code></pre>

<p>If you are lucky, you’ll receive a ticket to come back later in the afternoon when it reopens. It’s guaranteed entry, but they only give a certain number of those out.</p>

<p>Either way, you’ll end up waiting in a line of cars to get a spot.</p>

<p>Fredericksburg TX, or Fritztown, is an historical German town in Texas in the middle of Hill Country.</p>

<pre><code>With Valentine’s Day almost upon us, now is the time to think about expressing your love with something more than a card and a dozen roses. You can always still buy a card and flowers, but if you’re looking to do something different, you may want to consider a romantic weekend getaway. Head for the mountains for a couple of days away from it all, or visit a city for a weekend of culture and cocktails. Whatever your preference, there’s a romantic getaway within easy reach.

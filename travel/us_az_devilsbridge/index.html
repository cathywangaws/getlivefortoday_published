          <p>We were in Sodona, Arizona - the land of red rocks. Flew to Phoenix, AZ airport and then drove 2 hours to Sedona area for a day trip at November 16, 2019. It was a sunny and beautiful day. The temperature was about 70ish degrees without any wind. Arizona is a great escape destination from the cold weather. The song of 500 Miles Away From Home was a perfect song for this scenic road trip.</p>

<p>Devil’s Bridge is the largest natural sandstone arch in Sedona, AZ area. Don&rsquo;t let its name fool you. It is one of the most beautiful sights in this area.</p>

<p>Started at Mescal Trailhead to Chuckwagon to Devil’s Bridge trails from Long Canyon Road. Total is 4 miles round trip and moderate difficulty hiking. The trail is also shared with mountain bikers. You could rent a bike from Sedona town but hiking is my favorite outdoor activity.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the trail, it was effortless. The path was dusty, like walking on red sand, followed by a series of stone staircases leading up to the bridge.</p>

<p>The path slowly inclines uphill, gently growing more steep as you progress. The views of the surrounding landscape are completely stunning as we climbed higher.</p>

<p>At the end of the trail, we reached a fork that led us either to the base of the bridge, or a climb to the top. We did both.</p>

<p>The bridge is high up, has a huge arch, looks precarious and offers one of the prettiest sweeping views in Sedona. It is 75 feet high and solid a lot wider than you think and photos make it seem narrow and scary but the reality is very different. I walked across the top and Andy was taking pictures for me at the other side of the bridge. When Andy was waiting in the line for picturing taking, I joined him because I could be able to ask a young couple to take few snaps for us and they did excellent job! I also offered to take photos for them in return but they were scared of the height and didn&rsquo;t want to walk on the bridge at all!</p>

<p>People took their time to sit and enjoy the view and rewarded themselves for a hike well done!</p>

<p>After came down from the top, we also went to the base of the bridge. The path was narrow and lot of loose rocks. The view was totally different from below. It was worth the effort to stop here.</p>

<p>Sedona has a lot of hiking trails and other activities including Sliding Rock park, Cathedral Rock trail and upscale restaurants which we would love to come back for!</p>

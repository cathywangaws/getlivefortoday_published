It's hard to believe that this exotic is not only close to the United States but also part of it. Puerto Rico is located between the Carribean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. You don't need a passport to travel to this American territory.

The island was first ruled by the Spanish until 1898. Present-day Puerto Rico is a major tourist destination, and take pride in their unique combination of heritages: African, Spanish, and North American. 

Colorful streets, Old World architecture, killer cocktails, and a wonderfully warm people lend Puerto Rico a casual and fun vibe.

# Explore the Colorful Streets of Old San Juan
Nothing beats a peaceful morning walk around Old San Juan. In just seven square blocks, the old city packs of cobblestones and nearly 400 colorful Spanish-colonial buildings. 

# Visit El Morro
The Castillo San Felipe del Morro, aka El Morro, is a 400-year-old fort in the old town.
Over the centuries, it’s suffered attacks from the English, Dutch and America—but still stands as a symbol of pride for Puerto Rico. We explored this fortress - the lighthouse, the many garitas, and the Old Tower - all perfect settings for a fun photoshoot.


# Puerto Rican Cuisine
Mofongo, the unofficial national dish of Puerto Rico, a favorite island dish consisting of mashed green plantains fried with garlic and other seasonings, can be served plain or stuffed with meat or seafood.


Andy and I had an extraordinary weekend at San Juan. We strolled the old city in the early morning, explored a fun outdoor market, watched the sunset by the Ocean and tasted local drinks by the live band in the evening.

</code></pre>

<p>This year the independence holiday is Thursday so we took Friday off in order to have a long weekend. I spent 3 hours to find a less crowded flight routes at Tuesday night but seems like not possible. All flights were full with negative numbers. Lot of Americans would travel around the world during this summer that made standby was difficult.</p>

<p>Finally, I decided to try EWR. If we couldn’t get on a flight after work at Tuesday, we just went home and would think another plan at next day. Luckily, we got on the flight and we were flying to Newark, NY.</p>

<p>We arrived at EWR airport at about 10pm and then we took airport express shuttle bus to Port Authority Bus Terminal on Manhattan, NY that was about 30-mins driving. The bus dropped off us on the 41st street that is near Times Square. Our hotel, Paromont Hotel, is near Times Square too. There were still lot of people on the streets at about 11pm. It is really one of biggest cities in US. NY doesn’t have a quiet time. We checked in our hotel at midnight and we had a room on 15th floor. However, I still could hear the noise from streets. Sounds like parties were still going on! I think I get used to live in suburbs and not get used to this kind of noisy anymore.</p>

<p>Our friend, Karen, and her husband were also in the town to visit their son who works in NY. They invited us to have a brunch together and their son would cook for us in his high-raised apartment. Wow, we were so happy!</p>

<p>Next day, we got up at about 7:30am. We went to Times Square first. Then walked toward to Frank’s apartment where is not only about 20 mins walking distance from Times Square. We went to a supermarket to buy some fruits for them. Then we had our morning coffee at a Starbucks.</p>

<p>At 10 am, we went to Frank’s place for brunch. Frank was already in the kitchen to prepare breakfast for us. Four of us stayed in his room to chat and laugh. We were very good friends in MI. Now they still live in MI and we moved to IL. So we don’t have too many chances to meet each other. Each time, I go to Windsor to visit my mom and we by passed Detroit without time to meet them. But now, we met in New York city. That was unbelievable.</p>

<p>Frank is a very smart boy and very polite. His major is finance and graduated from MIT. After brunch, we talked about some finance topics since he is a financial annalist in a Manhattan company. His dream is open his own finance firm in a smaller city in the near future. I also got some advice about how to get familiar about stocks. He recommended me to read Buffet’s annual letter. Now I am reading the book of Dreamland. I am going to read one of letters at a time after this book. It is never too late to learn finance!
French toast, seafood omelet, and pan fried steaks</p>

<p>The brunch was very filling and quantity was big. We decided to walk to THE MET instead of riding a subway. We need to burn out these calories as much as we can.</p>

<p>THE MET was free until last year. Now a ticket is $25 for 3 days. The museum is really large and takes more than a day to see everything. My plan was just seeing Van Gogh’s paintings and Greece’s statues.</p>

<p>After visiting THE MET, we took subway to Canal Chinetown for dinner. First, we had XiAn special food. And then we had ShangHai food. So we went to 2 restaurants for dinner. There are so many good Chinese food in NY and I wish I could eat more…</p>

<p>Then we head back to the hotel. At 8pm we went back to our hotel room. We were out for 12 hours under 86F degrees. What is busy day in NY.</p>

<p>Next day, we got up at 6:20am because we planned to jog in Central Park this morning. This activity was on my bucket list for couple of years already. Glad I checked it off this time. Last time, we visited New York at least 10 years ago and at that time, I didn’t like running at all. So time can change a person!</p>

<p>The Central Park, New York City which is the most visited urban park in US and one of the most film locations in the world. Movies like “When Harry Met Sally (1989)”, “You’ve Got Mail”, “Maid in Manhattan (2002)”, “Big Daddy (1999)” etc.</p>

<p>The above 2 things (THE MET &amp; Central Park) were my plans for this visit so we decided to have a lunch and then took shuttle bus back to EWR airport. There are many places like Liberty Statue, Brooklyn Bridge, Ground Zero etc to see in New York. Maybe next time for me.</p>

<p><strong>Sculpture</strong></p>

<p>A sculpture – Perseus with the head of Medusa
Perseus stands naked except for a sash and winged sandals, triumphant on top of the body of Medusa with her snakey head in his raised hand.
During the Independence Holiday, I visited THE MET – the metropolitan museum of Art of New York City and this sculpture caught my eyes.
Why Did Medusa Get Cursed?</p>

<p>Medusa as originally being a beautiful maiden. Her beauty caught the eye of Poseidon, who desired her and proceeded to ravage her in Athena’s shrine. When Athena discovered the sea god had ravaged Medusa in her shrine she sought vengeance by transforming Medusa’s hair into snakes, so that anyone who gazed at her directly would be turned into stone.
The Legend of Perseus</p>

<p>In the myth of Perseus , the hero is sent by Polydectes, Dictys’ brother and the king of Seriphus, on a quest to bring him the head of Medusa. This was a trick because Polydectes desired Perseus’ mother and wanted to get rid of her son, who was not in favor of the relationship. Such a mission would have been equivalent to suicide for Perseus and Polydectes did not expect him to ever return to Seriphus.</p>

<p>As Perseus was the son of Zeus, he was aided by the gods. Perseus received the Cap of Invisibility from Hades, a pair of winged sandals from Hermes, a reflective bronze shield from Athena, and a sword from Hephaestus. With these divine gifts, Perseus sought out Medusa and decapitated her with the bronze shield while she was asleep.
Keeping the Medusa Myth Alive</p>

<p>Although Medusa is commonly regarded as a monster, her head is often seen as a protective amulet that would keep evil away. In fact, the name Medusa comes from an ancient Greek verb meaning “to guard or protect”.</p>

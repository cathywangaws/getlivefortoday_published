Arthritis is a common problem in Western countries. There are several different types, most of which involve inflammation in the joints.
Given that curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory compound, it makes sense that it may help with arthritis. Several studies show this to be true.
In a study in people with rheumatoid arthritis, curcumin was even more effective than an anti-inflammatory drug.Trusted Source">

<p><strong>Google Maps</strong></p>

<p>This is a tutorial for creating a custom travel map with Google Maps. I feel it is fun so I am going to use it for my trips.

</ul>

<p>Add places to your map</p>

<p>You can add important places by searching for locations or drawing them directly on the map.

<p>You can add restaurants, hotels, museums, and other public places to your map.</p>

<ul>
<li>In the search bar, type the name or address of a place.</li>

<p>I can’t believe that my turtles have eggs. We thought they were brothers. Apparently, they are sisters now. In this summer, we saw turtle tank has eggs. We got so surprised and we went on the internet and realized that female turtles can have eggs too!!!</p>

<p><strong>2018-05-04 Unexpected Busy</strong></p>

<p>I always think I work for fun. I don’t want to get stress from work. I don’t want to get big accomplishments at work. I just want to keep this work and use the flight benefits. I want to be a low key person at work! However…</p>

<p>However, this year is extremely busy. It is unexpected busy. I have been working day and night and even on weekends. Sometimes I am so stressful and tired. My boss wants me to lead the ServiceNow project that is not what I want. I just want to be an individual contributor. Finish my work and go home to relax. I miss these days!</p>

<p>I am supposed to finish all development work by this week and kick off UAT from next week. But I am working on one very complicate catalog item that no one wants to work on it. I have to take it over and finish it by this week. So this week feels like the most stressful week for me! A terrible week at work!</p>

<p>I skipped breakfast at home. Bought my favorite bagel and a grande coffee on the way to the office. Hoped they gave me energy to start my busy day!</p>

<p><strong>Summary at the end of year 2019</strong>
I realized that what I had done at work didn&rsquo;t get recognized. No formal training this year but others got few of them. It wasn&rsquo;t fair to me so no motivation to work hard. I just want to keep this job.</p>

<p>Probably my communication is poor so I didn&rsquo;t express my willings enough to my boss. I should improve of this weakness.</p>

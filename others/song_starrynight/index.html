<p>Vincent Van Gogh – one of the world’s foremost artists. I like few of his colorful and dynamic paints, Starry Starry Night and Sunflowers!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Starry, starry night</p>

<p>Flaming flowers that brightly blaze</p>

<p>Swirling clouds in violet haze</p>

<p>Reflect in Vincent’s eyes of china blue</p>

<p>Colors changing hue, morning fields of amber grain</p>

<p>Weathered faces lined in pain,</p>

<p>Are soothed beneath the artist’s loving hand</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was born in the Netherlands, where the rain can make things seem dark and gloomy. When he grew up, he eventually moved to the south of France, where the sun is stronger and the colors brighter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now I understand what you tried to say to me</p>

<p>How you suffered for your sanity 理智</p>

<p>How you tried to set them free</p>

<p>They would not listen, they did not know how</p>

<p>Perhaps they’ll listen now</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I visited the places he lived in south of France. I walked on the streets he walked in Arles. I saw the cafes he went and painted his paintings. I also saw the sunflower field at the backyard of the building he lived. I just wanted to sense his feelings and his emotions when he was painting. I was wondering he painted for living or for expression his feelings!</p>

<p>His paintings weren’t popular when he lived in the world. He was suffering for his living so he ended his life when he was 37 years old.</p>

<p>I could listen to this song again and again. The rythem and lyric touch me very much. When I was listening this song, I thought about his life. How much stress did he get while he was painting. He was so eager to sell his paintings so that he won&rsquo;t get sponsor from his younger brother. He only sold few of his painting during his life that was sad.</p>

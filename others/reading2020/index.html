<p><strong>12 Rules for life</strong></p>

<p><em>Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping</em></p>

<p>First, this chapter tries to explain why humans tend to not care for themselves the way they care for others. That is because we have the tendency to dislike ourselves since we know ourselves so well. </p>

<p>Then, this chapter assumes that we care for others because we don’t know them as well. We don’t see their flaws. We just don’t know them inside out the way we know ourselves.</p>

<p>This rule is self-explanatory. Treat yourself the way you would treat others. This isn’t about selfish about only care for yourself, but add yourself to that same category as others you care about. Actually, everyone around you who loves you wants you to take good care of yourself. It’s an innate feeling that we want to see people we love and care in a better place and having a better lifestyle.</p>

<p>some of the quotes from the chapter:</p>

<p>You need to consider the future and think:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What might my life look like if I were caring for myself properly?</p></li>

<li><p>What career would challenge me and render me productive and helpful, so that I could shoulder my share of the load, and enjoy the consequences?</p></li>

<li><p>What should I be doing, when I have some freedom, to improve my health, expand my knowledge, and strengthen my body?</p></li>

<li><p>You need to know where you are, so you can start to chart your course.</p></li>

<li><p>You need to know who you are, so that you understand your armament and bolster yourself in respect to your limitations.</p></li>

<li><p>You need to know where you are going, so that you can limit the extent of chaos in your life, restructure order, and bring the divine force of Hope to bear on the world.</p></li>

<li><p>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</p></li>

<li><p>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</p></li>

<li><p>You must discipline yourself carefully.</p></li>

<li><p>You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</p></li>

<li><p>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</p></li>

<li><p>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To treat yourself as if you were someone you are responsible for helping is, instead, to consider what would be truly good for you. This is not &ldquo;what you want.&rdquo; It is also not &ldquo;what would make you happy.&rdquo; Every time you give a child something sweet, you make that child happy. That does not mean that you should do nothing for children except feed them candy… You must help a child become a virtuous, responsible, awake being, capable of full reciprocity—able to take care of himself and others, and to thrive while doing so. Why would you think it acceptable to do anything less for yourself?</p>

<p><em>Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back</em></p>

<p>Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of being. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe.</p>

<p>Standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only physical, because you are not only a body. You are a spirit!</p>

<p>Thus emboldened, you will embark on the voyage of your life, let your light shine and pursue your destiny! Then you may be able to accept the terrible burden of the World, and find joy.</p>

<p><strong>Rich Dad Poor Dad</strong></p>

<p>My first book I have read on financial literacy! It is a life-changing book for me. Now I have desire, passion, and interest to invest in learning about finance. My goal is to invest money by myself instead of a financial advisor. I believe it is never too late to start investment by myself!</p>

<ul>
<li>The rich don&rsquo;t work for money</li>
<li>Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. We need action.</li>
<li>Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill!</li>
<li>True learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire.

<ul>
<li>Financial literacy</li>
<li>Understanding the market</li>
<li>Train your mind and courage and practice. Remember to have fun.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of losing, because failure is part of the process of success.</li>
<li>Work to learn. Don&rsquo;t work for money!</li>

<p><strong>The Thorn Birds</strong></p>

<p>The Thorn Birds is a 1977 best-selling novel by the Australian author Colleen McCullough.
In 1983, the novel was adapted into a television series also called The Thorn Birds.</p>

<p>In the front matter of the book, the myth is set out:</p>

<p>There is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. And, dying, it rises above its own agony to out-carol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain&hellip;. Or so says the legend.</p>

<p>Chapter 1</p>

<p>Today was Maggie’s birthday and she got a surprise beautiful doll gift from her mom. From here, the book started to introduce each family member - a couple with 6 kids and Maggie was the youngest one and only daughter in the family. </p>

<p>Reading was the entrance into a world so fascinating!
Envy = jealous</p>

<p><strong>WILD</strong></p>

<p>8/30/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>“Wild” - a best non-fiction book of year 2012. I bought this ebook a few years ago but I didn’t get a chance to read it yet. Sometimes, I think borrowing a book from a library is better than bought a book by yourself because it pushes you to finish reading before the deadline. Fortunately, I am a member of the Tomato Group now so that it encourages me to keep reading books that I am interested in and no matter where I am and in what time zone. </p>

<p>Wild is a memoir. The author was from lost to found on the Pacific Creat Trail (PCT). She hiked 1100 miles as a journey of self-discovery. Sometimes, we may need to change or adjust ourselves in order to keep our position energy and be grateful for our life.</p>

<p>Oh, I did remember that I was touched when watching the movie in a flight that I couldn’t remember where I went to on the flight, and I expect to watch it again after reading this book!</p>

WILD 
Chapter 1: The Ten Thousand Things</p>

<p>Her solo three-month hike on PCT had many beginnings - quitting her job as a waitress, finalizing her divorce, selling almost everything she owned, and then shopping, packing, preparing to do it!</p>

<p>What caused her to make the decision? In her first chapter, she described her family, how she was raised up,  and more important was that her mother passed away that broke her up and cut her off. So she wanted the things to be different than they were before. So she decided to hike from Mojave desert, California to the Bridge of the Gods, Washington by herself. </p>

Chapter 2 - Splitting</p>

<p>At a hot summer night, she checked in a motel where it was just miles away from the PCT trail. The front desk asked her the resident address but she wasn’t sure where she would live afterward&hellip; it sounds pretty sad when I read here but I think she is a strong woman. She would find something to do to get rid of her suffer. She was alone but she set up a short term goal. She needed time to change and to find her lost!</p>

WILD 
Chapter 3 - Hunching in a Remotely Upright Position</p>

<p>When she leaned into the mirror and stared into her own eyes, she described at herself as “the woman with the hole in her heart”! That is why she decided to hike along for three months on the PCT. </p>

<p>In this chapter, she described all of her hiking gears. REI is a great store for hiking and climbing gears and people who work there are knowledgeable so you can consult before you buy anything. We usually buy our hiking shoes from REI because we need new pairs of hiking shoes for every two or three years. </p>

Chapter 4 - the PCT, Volume 1: California </p>

<p>She bought the book of The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume 1: California from the REI and read it a dozen times over a few months. She got the thought about the PCT would make her to find her strength back!</p>

<p>It was 12 miles from the motel where she stayed for the overnight to the PCT trailhead. She planned to start from here, so she did hitchhiking in the hot June day in the desert with a heavy backpack in order to save her energy for her long backpacking trail. </p>

<p>The first steps down the trail was to the brown metal box to register. She read the names and notes from the previous hikers in the weeks ahead of her, most of them men traveling in pairs, no one of them was a woman alone. However, she knew there was nothing to do but go!</p>

<p>WILD
Chapter 5 - Tracks
She planned 14 miles a day over her trip but she just did 1 mile per hour for 9 hours a day in her first couple of days. She reached the first water source in her third day. She used her purifier pumped the water from the Golden Oak Springs. She refilled the bottles and bag that was totally 25 pounds. The next water source was 19 miles away. I never did backcountry hiking. I couldn’t imagine if I could walk with 25 lbs of  water. I do day hiking but I don’t carry a backpack at all because my husband carry’s everything for us.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 - a bull in both directions</p>

<p>Cheryl met another hiker, a refrigerator size bear, and a coiled up snake on PCT trail. So far she had been hiked for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 - the only girl in the woods</p>

<p>Cheryle made it to her first stop - Kennedy Meadows. She picked up her supply at the General Store.</p>

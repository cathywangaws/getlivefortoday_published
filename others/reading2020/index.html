12 Rules for life Rule 12: PET A CAT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER ONE ON THE STREET 生活中遭遇危机时如何应对？
生活的压力不会因为你遭受了不幸就停止出现，每天要做的事情还是得做。如何才能坚持下去呢？每天留出一些时间来集中思考和讨论所有的危机和应对方式，其他时间就忘掉这些事情。
如果你不限制危机事情对你的影响，最后就只会筋疲力尽。你需要保存实力，因为这是一场战争，而不是一次战斗。你需要尽力应对组成战争的每一场战斗。
你足够认真的话，其实是能够承受住压力的。人是非常坚毅的动物，能够承受巨大的痛苦和损失，但是，前提是你需要先看到存在的好处，否则你就真的输了。
也许，累得晕头转向的你外出散步时会遇到一只猫，如果你能注意到它，那么在接下来的15秒里你也许会想到：存在的美好也许可以平衡生命中无法消除的痛苦。
当你在街上遇到一只猫，摸摸它。

<h3 id="rule-11-do-not-bother-children-when-they-are-skateboarding">Rule 11: Do not bother children when they are skateboarding</h3>

<p>能力才能让一个人在最大程度上感到安全。</p>

<p>未来需要的是坚毅而非软弱。男性需要变得更坚毅一些，女性也一样。</p>

<h3 id="rule-10-be-precise-in-your-speech">Rule 10: Be precise in your speech</h3>

<p>Be careful with what you tell yourself and others about what you have done, what you are doing, and where you are going. Search for the correct words. Organize those words into the correct sentences, and those sentences into the correct paragraphs. The past can be redeemed, when reduced by precise language to its essence. The present can flow by without robbing the future if its realities are spoken out clearly. With careful thought and language, the singular, stellar destiny that justifies existence can be extracted from the multitude of murky and unpleasant futures that are far more likely to manifest themselves of their own accord. This is how the Eye and the Word make habitable order.</p>

<p>You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with.</p>

<p>Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. That is how you discover the meaning of your life. That will protect you from the tragedy of your life. How could it be otherwise?</p>

<p>Confront the chaos of Being. Take aim against a sea of troubles. Specify your destination, and chart your course. Admit to what you want. Tell those around you who you are. Narrow, and gaze attentively, and move forward, forthrightly.</p>

<p>直面存在的混乱，瞄准麻烦的海洋，明确目的地，然后绘制航线。承认你想要的东西，让周围的人知道你是谁。精准注视，径直前行。</p>

<h3 id="rule-8-tell-the-truth-or-at-least-don-t-lie">Rule 8: Tell the truth. Or, at least, don’t lie</h3>

<p>To tell the truth is to bring the most habitable reality into Being. Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years. Truth feeds and clothes the poor, and makes nations wealthy and safe. Truth reduces the terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word, so that he can become a partner, rather than an enemy. Truth makes the past truly past, and makes the best use of the future’s possibilities. Truth is the ultimate, inexhaustible natural resource. It’s the light in the darkness.</p>

<p>Your truth is something only you can tell, based as it is on the unique circumstances of your life. Apprehend your personal truth. Communicate it carefully, in an articulate manner, to yourself and others. This will ensure your security and your life more abundantly now, while you inhabit the structure of your current beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="rule-7-pursue-what-is-meaningful-not-what-is-expedient">Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient.</h3>

<p>To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want, because you may neither know what you want, nor what you truly need. Meaning is something that comes upon you. You can set up the preconditions, you can follow meaning, when it manifests itself, but you cannot simply produce it, as an act of will. Meaning signifies that you are in the right place, at the right time, properly balanced between order and chaos, where everything lines up as best it can at that moment.</p>

<p>Meaning is what emerges beautifully and profoundly like a newly formed rosebud opening itself out of nothingness into the light of sun and God.</p>

<p>Meaning is the lotus striving upward through the dark lake depths
“through the ever-clearing water, blooming forth on the very surface, revealing within itself the Golden Buddha, himself perfectly integrated, such that the revelation of the Divine Will can make itself manifest in his every word and gesture.</p>

<p>Meaning is when everything there is comes together in an ecstatic dance of single purpose—the glorification of a reality so that no matter how good it has suddenly become, it can get better and better and better more and more deeply forever into the future. Meaning happens when that dance has become so intense that all the horrors of the past, all the terrible struggle engaged in by all of life and all of humanity to that moment becomes a necessary and worthwhile part of the increasingly successful attempt to build something truly Mighty and Good.</p>

<p>Meaning is the ultimate balance between, on the one hand, the chaos of transformation and possibility and on the other, the discipline of pristine order, whose purpose is to produce out of the attendant chaos a new order that will be even more immaculate, and capable of bringing forth a still more balanced and productive chaos and order.</p>

<p>Meaning is the Way, the path of life more abundant, the place you live when you are guided by Love and speaking Truth and when nothing you want or could possibly want takes any precedence over precisely that.</p>

<h3 id="rule-6-set-your-house-in-perfect-order-before-you-criticize-the-world">Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world</h3>

<h3 id="rule-4-compare-yourself-to-who-you-were-yesterday-not-to-who-someone-else-is-today">Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today</h3>

<p>No matter how good you are at something, or how you rank your accomplishments, there is someone out there who makes you look incompetent.</p>

<p>You might object: I should be winning at everything! But winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</p>

<p>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</p>

<p>And you do the same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And, with each day, your baseline of comparison gets a little higher, and that is magic.</p>

<p>That’s compound interest. Do that for three years, and your life will be entirely different. Now you’re aiming for something higher. Now you’re wishing on a star. And what you aim at determines what you see. That’s worth repeating. What you aim at determines what you see.</p>

<p>If you ask, as if you want, and knock, as if you want to enter, you may be offered the chance to improve your life, a little; a lot; completely—and with that improvement, some progress will be made in Being itself.</p>

<h4 id="rule-3-make-friends-with-people-who-want-the-best-for-you">Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you</h4>

<p>It is not a selfish thing to choose people who are good for you. It is appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people who lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</p>

<p>If we surround ourself with people who support our upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not. This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</p>

<p>Just like our Reading Club. We choose each other as friends virtually. We all like reading books and share our opinions. We want to improve ourselves with our friendship here. We never meet in person and we don&rsquo;t know what we look like and our profession but we have same goals. As friends we give our recommendations and encourage each other. Therefore we make friends with people who want the best of us!</p>

<h4 id="rule-2-treat-yourself-like-someone-you-are-responsible-for-helping">Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping</h4>

<p>First, this chapter tries to explain why humans tend to not care for themselves the way they care for others. That is because we have the tendency to dislike ourselves since we know ourselves so well. </p>

<p>Then, this chapter assumes that we care for others because we don’t know them as well. We don’t see their flaws. We just don’t know them inside out the way we know ourselves.</p>

<p>This rule is self-explanatory. Treat yourself the way you would treat others. This isn’t about selfish about only care for yourself, but add yourself to that same category as others you care about. Actually, everyone around you who loves you wants you to take good care of yourself. It’s an innate feeling that we want to see people we love and care in a better place and having a better lifestyle.</p>

<p>some of the quotes from the chapter:</p>

<p>You need to consider the future and think:</p>

<ul>
<li>What might my life look like if I were caring for myself properly?</li>
<li>What career would challenge me and render me productive and helpful, so that I could shoulder my share of the load, and enjoy the consequences?</li>
<li>What should I be doing, when I have some freedom, to improve my health, expand my knowledge, and strengthen my body?</li>
<li>You need to know where you are, so you can start to chart your course.</li>
<li>You need to know who you are, so that you understand your armament and bolster yourself in respect to your limitations.</li>
<li>You need to know where you are going, so that you can limit the extent of chaos in your life, restructure order, and bring the divine force of Hope to bear on the world.</li>
<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>
<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>
<li>You must discipline yourself carefully.</li>
<li>You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>
<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>
<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>
</ul>

<p>To treat yourself as if you were someone you are responsible for helping is, instead, to consider what would be truly good for you. This is not &ldquo;what you want.&rdquo; It is also not &ldquo;what would make you happy.&rdquo; Every time you give a child something sweet, you make that child happy. That does not mean that you should do nothing for children except feed them candy… You must help a child become a virtuous, responsible, awake being, capable of full reciprocity—able to take care of himself and others, and to thrive while doing so. Why would you think it acceptable to do anything less for yourself?</p>

<h4 id="rule-1-stand-up-straight-with-your-shoulders-back">Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back</h4>

<p>Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of being. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe.</p>

<p>Standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only physical, because you are not only a body. You are a spirit!</p>

<p>Thus emboldened, you will embark on the voyage of your life, let your light shine and pursue your destiny! Then you may be able to accept the terrible burden of the World, and find joy.</p>

<p>My first book I have read on financial literacy! It is a life-changing book for me. Now I have desire, passion, and interest to invest in learning about finance. My goal is to invest money by myself instead of a financial advisor. I believe it is never too late to start investment by myself!</p>

<li>Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. We need action.</li>
<li>Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill!</li>
<li>True learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire.

<li>Financial literacy</li>

Chapter 7 is alson an important chapter that needs to read again. It is about testing Terrform code (TerraTest).</p>

<h1 id="the-thorn-birds">The Thorn Birds</h1>

<p>The Thorn Birds is a 1977 best-selling novel by the Australian author Colleen McCullough.
In 1983, the novel was adapted into a television series also called The Thorn Birds.</p>

<p>In the front matter of the book, the myth is set out:</p>

<p>There is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. And, dying, it rises above its own agony to out-carol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain&hellip;. Or so says the legend.</p>

<p>Chapter 1</p>

<p>Today was Maggie’s birthday and she got a surprise beautiful doll gift from her mom. From here, the book started to introduce each family member - a couple with 6 kids and Maggie was the youngest one and only daughter in the family. </p>

<p>Reading was the entrance into a world so fascinating!
Envy = jealous</p>

<h1 id="wild">WILD</h1>

<p>8/30/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>“Wild” - a best non-fiction book of year 2012. I bought this ebook a few years ago but I didn’t get a chance to read it yet. Sometimes, I think borrowing a book from a library is better than bought a book by yourself because it pushes you to finish reading before the deadline. Fortunately, I am a member of the Tomato Group now so that it encourages me to keep reading books that I am interested in and no matter where I am and in what time zone. </p>

<p>Wild is a memoir. The author was from lost to found on the Pacific Creat Trail (PCT). She hiked 1100 miles as a journey of self-discovery. Sometimes, we may need to change or adjust ourselves in order to keep our position energy and be grateful for our life.</p>

<p>Oh, I did remember that I was touched when watching the movie in a flight that I couldn’t remember where I went to on the flight, and I expect to watch it again after reading this book!</p>

WILD 
Chapter 1: The Ten Thousand Things</p>

<p>Her solo three-month hike on PCT had many beginnings - quitting her job as a waitress, finalizing her divorce, selling almost everything she owned, and then shopping, packing, preparing to do it!</p>

<p>What caused her to make the decision? In her first chapter, she described her family, how she was raised up,  and more important was that her mother passed away that broke her up and cut her off. So she wanted the things to be different than they were before. So she decided to hike from Mojave desert, California to the Bridge of the Gods, Washington by herself. </p>

<p>9/3/2019  🍅打卡
WILD
Chapter 2 - Splitting</p>

<p>At a hot summer night, she checked in a motel where it was just miles away from the PCT trail. The front desk asked her the resident address but she wasn’t sure where she would live afterward&hellip; it sounds pretty sad when I read here but I think she is a strong woman. She would find something to do to get rid of her suffer. She was alone but she set up a short term goal. She needed time to change and to find her lost!</p>

<p>9/4/2019 🍅打卡
WILD 
Chapter 3 - Hunching in a Remotely Upright Position</p>

<p>When she leaned into the mirror and stared into her own eyes, she described at herself as “the woman with the hole in her heart”! That is why she decided to hike along for three months on the PCT. </p>

<p>In this chapter, she described all of her hiking gears. REI is a great store for hiking and climbing gears and people who work there are knowledgeable so you can consult before you buy anything. We usually buy our hiking shoes from REI because we need new pairs of hiking shoes for every two or three years. </p>

<p>9/7/2019 🍅打卡
WILD
Chapter 4 - the PCT, Volume 1: California </p>

<p>She bought the book of The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume 1: California from the REI and read it a dozen times over a few months. She got the thought about the PCT would make her to find her strength back!</p>

<p>It was 12 miles from the motel where she stayed for the overnight to the PCT trailhead. She planned to start from here, so she did hitchhiking in the hot June day in the desert with a heavy backpack in order to save her energy for her long backpacking trail. </p>

<p>The first steps down the trail was to the brown metal box to register. She read the names and notes from the previous hikers in the weeks ahead of her, most of them men traveling in pairs, no one of them was a woman alone. However, she knew there was nothing to do but go!</p>

<p>WILD
Chapter 5 - Tracks
She planned 14 miles a day over her trip but she just did 1 mile per hour for 9 hours a day in her first couple of days. She reached the first water source in her third day. She used her purifier pumped the water from the Golden Oak Springs. She refilled the bottles and bag that was totally 25 pounds. The next water source was 19 miles away. I never did backcountry hiking. I couldn’t imagine if I could walk with 25 lbs of  water. I do day hiking but I don’t carry a backpack at all because my husband carry’s everything for us.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 - a bull in both directions</p>

<p>Cheryl met another hiker, a refrigerator size bear, and a coiled up snake on PCT trail. So far she had been hiked for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 - the only girl in the woods</p>

<p>Cheryle made it to her first stop - Kennedy Meadows. She picked up her supply at the General Store.</p>

<h1 id="坚毅-the-key-to-success">坚毅 &ndash; The Key To Success</h1>

<p>美籍亚裔心理学家、宾夕法尼亚大学副教授Angela Lee Duckworth写的【Grit The power of passion and Perseverance </p>

<p>“To be gritty is to keep putting one foot in front of the other. To be gritty is to hold fast to an interesting and purposeful goal. To be gritty is to invest, day after week after year, in challenging practice. To be gritty is to fall seven times, and rise eight.” Grit是对长期目标的持续激情及持久耐力；是不忘初衷、专注投入、坚持不懈；是一种包涵了自我激励、自我约束和自我调整的性格特征。如果一个人能很投入、一直做一件事很久，她就具备坚毅的品格。 向着长期的目标，坚持自己的激情，即便历经失败，依然能够坚持不懈地努力下去，这种品质就叫做坚毅。</p>

<p>努力 双倍重要 Effort counts twice 
Duckworth认为天分是与生俱来的，而坚毅是每个人通过努力都可以获得的。关于成就，Duckworth提出的理论公式是:  
天分x 努力 = 技能(talent x effort = skill)
技能x 努力 = 成就(skill x effort = achievement)</p>

<p> “Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort. Achievement is what happens when you take your acquired skills and use them. “ Duckworth认为天分是付出努力以后技能提高的速度，而成就则是运用获得的技能收获的结果。天分很重要，但努力在理论公式上加倍重要,因为它被乘了两次。“effort builds skill, effort makes skill productive.” 努力可以培养技能，努力也会使技能更有效力。</p>

<p>天分x 努力 = 技能(talent x effort = skill)
 </p>

<p>培养坚毅力&ndash;由内而外的四大驱动力
 第一个驱动力是兴趣(interest)。热情开始于真心喜欢你所做的事。每一位作者所研究的坚毅力典范都有不喜欢工作的某些面向，他们通常必须忍受一两件讨厌的杂物。但是整体工作还是令他们深深着迷，令他们执着不变。</p>

<p> 第二个驱动力是练习(practice)。每天尽可能把事情做得比前一天更好，这种日常的纪律是种坚持力。在某个领域发现及培养兴趣以后，必须全心全力投入练习，寻求进步，达到纯熟的境界，克服自己的缺点。每天必须投入数小时练习，日复一日，年复一年。坚毅力能够抵抗自满的心态，所有坚毅力的典范不分领域，无论多优秀，他们都不会停止进步。</p>

<p> 第三个驱动力是目的(purpose)。深深相信你在做的事很重要，热情才会成熟。我特别认同作者关于“以帮助别人，为社会创造价值为目标更容易让人成长坚毅的品格”的观点。</p>

<p> 最后一个驱动力是希望（hope)。希望是让一个人能够面对各种处境的毅力。定义一个人是否坚毅，最关键的就是看他在遇到困难，产生自我怀疑时，是否学习坚持下去。在不同时刻，我们都会遇到各种挫折，如果让自己消沉，坚毅就会不断消减。唯有再接再厉，坚毅才会越来越高。

<p>培养坚毅力&ndash;由外而内的三大环境力
1) 家庭教养, 榜样的力量，2) 课外活动练习对困难事物的坚持以及3) 同伴的鞭策力三方面讲述了环境对一个人培养坚毅的重要性。</p>

Martin Luther once said, “If you want to change the world, pick up your pen and write.” I’d add that if you want to change your world, pick up a book and read.</p>

<p>《坚毅》</p>

<p>本书思想核心是：Grit，坚毅，是当下非常时髦的新概念。它由激情和坚持两部分组成，二者缺一不可。</p>

<p>坚毅=激情+坚持</p>

<p>在作者看来，激情不是刹那间的决定。相反，激情需要时间去慢慢发现。在这个阶段，开心比努力更重要，我们关注的是这个事情好不好玩，自己愿意不愿意投入精力，而不是一上来就要求自己做到最好。激情需要不断的探索和尝试。</p>

<p>有了激情，还要坚持。坚毅更关注持久的耐力，而不是强度。坚毅更关心的，是你是否对自己的目标保持忠诚。也就是说，做你所爱的事情，并且持续地去爱。</p>

<p>坚毅是比智商、情商、自控力等更重要的品质。</p>

<p>如何提高自己的坚毅指数。</p>

<p>第一步，找到自己的激情。这个需要前期大量的尝试。作者认为，即使是在发展兴趣这件事上，也是需要努力的。大多数的坚毅典范都花了很多年去探索自己的兴趣，而那个最终占据他们心灵的事情，并不是他们第一次遇到时就被认出的。</p>

<p>第二步，进行至刻意练习。一万小时天才理论大家都听过，就是花很长时间去练习。但是坚毅，不仅在于一个人投入到某项兴趣上的时间，还在于投入的质量。作者在书里介绍了专业高手的练习方式：先找到需要改进的一个微小方面，然后全神贯注地投入和努力，并寻求外界的反馈，之后再依据反馈一遍又一遍地调整和练习，直到此前的不足变成无意识的能力。</p>

<p>第三步，将技能与帮助他人的目标相结合。作者认为，激情源于兴趣，也源于目标。所谓目标，就是你的人生使命，也就是造福他人的意图。</p>

<p>无论你从事什么工作，都需要不断审视自己，不断思考如何与其他人联结，如何与更广阔的世界联结，如何展示你内心深处的价值观。</p>

<p>最后一步，要拥有成长心态，更好地面对过程中的挫折和挑战，从而坚持下去。世上没有一件事是百分百完美的。即使做自己再喜欢的事情，你也会有烦心的时刻，能否正确处理这样的问题，是你能否长期坚持下去的重要因素。</p>

<p>如果你相信，只要有合适的机会和足够的支持，只要你努力并且自信，你就能成功。成长心态帮助你用乐观的方式解释逆境，它让你充满希望，不断寻求新的挑战，并让自己更强大。而固定心态，则是当你受到某些打击时，你会将挫折理解为“自己不行”的证据，并认为自己永远不可能做好。它会让你放弃挑战，且在日后习惯性地躲避挑战。</p>

<h1 id="we-write-to-taste-life-twice-in-the-moment-and-in-retrospect">We write to taste life twice, in the moment and in retrospect</h1>

<p>“Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.”</p>

<p>“A blank piece of paper is God&rsquo;s way of telling us how hard it is to be God.”</p>

<p>Why do you need to write better?
— Because writing well helps structure your thought process, convey your message better, and build your character.</p>

<p>— Because writing is the basis upon which your work and intellect will be judged.</p>

<p>— Because writing makes your thinking and ideas visible and permanent.</p>

<p>Here’s the secret: To get good at it, you have to write — more than you think and on a regular basis(!)</p>

<p>想变得更好吗？投稿过来，我看看。</p>

<p>在我给大家准备课案的时候，大家可以先开始一些预习工作。引用一下Stephen King的一句话，”If you don&rsquo;t have time to read, you don&rsquo;t have the time or the tools to write. Simple as that.” 多读才能写，要坚持阅读坚持练习写作✏️</p>

<p>Grit The power of passion 
and Perseverance</p>

<p>“To be gritty is to keep putting one foot in front of the other. To be gritty is to hold fast to an interesting and purposeful goal. To be gritty is to invest, day after week after year, in challenging practice. To be gritty is to fall seven times, and rise eight.” Grit是对长期目标的持续激情及持久耐力；是不忘初衷、专注投入、坚持不懈；是一种包涵了自我激励、自我约束和自我调整的性格特征。如果一个人能很投入、一直做一件事很久，她就具备坚毅的品格。 向着长期的目标，坚持自己的激情，即便历经失败，依然能够坚持不懈地努力下去，这种品质就叫做坚毅。</p>

<p> “Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort. Achievement is what happens when you take your acquired skills and use them. “ Duckworth认为天分是付出努力以后技能提高的速度，而成就则是运用获得的技能收获的结果。天分很重要，但努力在理论公式上加倍重要,因为它被乘了两次。“effort builds skill, effort makes skill productive.” 努力可以培养技能，努力也会使技能更有效力。</p>

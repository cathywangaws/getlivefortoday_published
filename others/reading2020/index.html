12 Rules for life Rule 12: PET A CAT WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER ONE ON THE STREET 生活中遭遇危机时如何应对？
生活的压力不会因为你遭受了不幸就停止出现，每天要做的事情还是得做。如何才能坚持下去呢？每天留出一些时间来集中思考和讨论所有的危机和应对方式，其他时间就忘掉这些事情。
如果你不限制危机事情对你的影响，最后就只会筋疲力尽。你需要保存实力，因为这是一场战争，而不是一次战斗。你需要尽力应对组成战争的每一场战斗。
你足够认真的话，其实是能够承受住压力的。人是非常坚毅的动物，能够承受巨大的痛苦和损失，但是，前提是你需要先看到存在的好处，否则你就真的输了。
也许，累得晕头转向的你外出散步时会遇到一只猫，如果你能注意到它，那么在接下来的15秒里你也许会想到：存在的美好也许可以平衡生命中无法消除的痛苦。
当你在街上遇到一只猫，摸摸它。

<h3 id="rule-11-do-not-bother-children-when-they-are-skateboarding">Rule 11: Do not bother children when they are skateboarding</h3>

<p>能力才能让一个人在最大程度上感到安全。</p>

<p>未来需要的是坚毅而非软弱。男性需要变得更坚毅一些，女性也一样。</p>

<h3 id="rule-10-be-precise-in-your-speech">Rule 10: Be precise in your speech</h3>

<p>Be careful with what you tell yourself and others about what you have done, what you are doing, and where you are going. Search for the correct words. Organize those words into the correct sentences, and those sentences into the correct paragraphs. The past can be redeemed, when reduced by precise language to its essence. The present can flow by without robbing the future if its realities are spoken out clearly. With careful thought and language, the singular, stellar destiny that justifies existence can be extracted from the multitude of murky and unpleasant futures that are far more likely to manifest themselves of their own accord. This is how the Eye and the Word make habitable order.</p>

<p>You must determine where you are going in your life, because you cannot get there unless you move in that direction. Random wandering will not move you forward. It will instead disappoint and frustrate you and make you anxious and unhappy and hard to get along with.</p>

<p>Say what you mean, so that you can find out what you mean. Act out what you say, so you can find out what happens. Then pay attention. Note your errors. Articulate them. Strive to correct them. That is how you discover the meaning of your life. That will protect you from the tragedy of your life. How could it be otherwise?</p>

<p>Confront the chaos of Being. Take aim against a sea of troubles. Specify your destination, and chart your course. Admit to what you want. Tell those around you who you are. Narrow, and gaze attentively, and move forward, forthrightly.</p>

<p>直面存在的混乱，瞄准麻烦的海洋，明确目的地，然后绘制航线。承认你想要的东西，让周围的人知道你是谁。精准注视，径直前行。</p>

<h3 id="rule-8-tell-the-truth-or-at-least-don-t-lie">Rule 8: Tell the truth. Or, at least, don’t lie</h3>

<p>To tell the truth is to bring the most habitable reality into Being. Truth builds edifices that can stand a thousand years. Truth feeds and clothes the poor, and makes nations wealthy and safe. Truth reduces the terrible complexity of a man to the simplicity of his word, so that he can become a partner, rather than an enemy. Truth makes the past truly past, and makes the best use of the future’s possibilities. Truth is the ultimate, inexhaustible natural resource. It’s the light in the darkness.</p>

<p>Your truth is something only you can tell, based as it is on the unique circumstances of your life. Apprehend your personal truth. Communicate it carefully, in an articulate manner, to yourself and others. This will ensure your security and your life more abundantly now, while you inhabit the structure of your current beliefs.</p>

<h3 id="rule-7-pursue-what-is-meaningful-not-what-is-expedient">Rule 7: Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient.</h3>

<p>To have meaning in your life is better than to have what you want, because you may neither know what you want, nor what you truly need. Meaning is something that comes upon you. You can set up the preconditions, you can follow meaning, when it manifests itself, but you cannot simply produce it, as an act of will. Meaning signifies that you are in the right place, at the right time, properly balanced between order and chaos, where everything lines up as best it can at that moment.</p>

<p>Meaning is what emerges beautifully and profoundly like a newly formed rosebud opening itself out of nothingness into the light of sun and God.</p>

<p>Meaning is the lotus striving upward through the dark lake depths
“through the ever-clearing water, blooming forth on the very surface, revealing within itself the Golden Buddha, himself perfectly integrated, such that the revelation of the Divine Will can make itself manifest in his every word and gesture.</p>

<p>Meaning is when everything there is comes together in an ecstatic dance of single purpose—the glorification of a reality so that no matter how good it has suddenly become, it can get better and better and better more and more deeply forever into the future. Meaning happens when that dance has become so intense that all the horrors of the past, all the terrible struggle engaged in by all of life and all of humanity to that moment becomes a necessary and worthwhile part of the increasingly successful attempt to build something truly Mighty and Good.</p>

<p>Meaning is the ultimate balance between, on the one hand, the chaos of transformation and possibility and on the other, the discipline of pristine order, whose purpose is to produce out of the attendant chaos a new order that will be even more immaculate, and capable of bringing forth a still more balanced and productive chaos and order.</p>

<p>Meaning is the Way, the path of life more abundant, the place you live when you are guided by Love and speaking Truth and when nothing you want or could possibly want takes any precedence over precisely that.</p>

<h3 id="rule-6-set-your-house-in-perfect-order-before-you-criticize-the-world">Rule 6: Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world</h3>

<h3 id="rule-4-compare-yourself-to-who-you-were-yesterday-not-to-who-someone-else-is-today">Rule 4: Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today</h3>

<p>No matter how good you are at something, or how you rank your accomplishments, there is someone out there who makes you look incompetent.</p>

<p>You might object: I should be winning at everything! But winning at everything might only mean that you’re not doing anything new or difficult. You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.</p>

<p>Thus, you set the following goal: by the end of the day, I want things in my life to be a tiny bit better than they were this morning.</p>

<p>And you do the same thing tomorrow, and the next day, and the next. And, with each day, your baseline of comparison gets a little higher, and that is magic.</p>

<p>That’s compound interest. Do that for three years, and your life will be entirely different. Now you’re aiming for something higher. Now you’re wishing on a star. And what you aim at determines what you see. That’s worth repeating. What you aim at determines what you see.</p>

<p>If you ask, as if you want, and knock, as if you want to enter, you may be offered the chance to improve your life, a little; a lot; completely—and with that improvement, some progress will be made in Being itself.</p>

<h4 id="rule-3-make-friends-with-people-who-want-the-best-for-you">Rule 3: Make friends with people who want the best for you</h4>

<p>It is not a selfish thing to choose people who are good for you. It is appropriate and praiseworthy to associate with people who lives would be improved if they saw your life improve.</p>

<p>If we surround ourself with people who support our upward aim, they will not tolerate your cynicism and destructiveness. They will instead encourage you when you do good for yourself and others and punish you carefully when you do not. This will help bolster your resolve to do what you should do, in the most appropriate and careful manner.</p>

<p>Just like our Reading Club. We choose each other as friends virtually. We all like reading books and share our opinions. We want to improve ourselves with our friendship here. We never meet in person and we don&rsquo;t know what we look like and our profession but we have same goals. As friends we give our recommendations and encourage each other. Therefore we make friends with people who want the best of us!</p>

<h4 id="rule-2-treat-yourself-like-someone-you-are-responsible-for-helping">Rule 2: Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping</h4>

<p>First, this chapter tries to explain why humans tend to not care for themselves the way they care for others. That is because we have the tendency to dislike ourselves since we know ourselves so well. </p>

<p>Then, this chapter assumes that we care for others because we don’t know them as well. We don’t see their flaws. We just don’t know them inside out the way we know ourselves.</p>

<p>This rule is self-explanatory. Treat yourself the way you would treat others. This isn’t about selfish about only care for yourself, but add yourself to that same category as others you care about. Actually, everyone around you who loves you wants you to take good care of yourself. It’s an innate feeling that we want to see people we love and care in a better place and having a better lifestyle.</p>

<p>some of the quotes from the chapter:</p>

<p>You need to consider the future and think:</p>

<ul>
<li>What might my life look like if I were caring for myself properly?</li>
<li>What career would challenge me and render me productive and helpful, so that I could shoulder my share of the load, and enjoy the consequences?</li>
<li>What should I be doing, when I have some freedom, to improve my health, expand my knowledge, and strengthen my body?</li>
<li>You need to know where you are, so you can start to chart your course.</li>
<li>You need to know who you are, so that you understand your armament and bolster yourself in respect to your limitations.</li>
<li>You need to know where you are going, so that you can limit the extent of chaos in your life, restructure order, and bring the divine force of Hope to bear on the world.</li>
<li>You must determine where you are going, so that you can bargain for yourself, so that you don’t end up resentful, vengeful and cruel.</li>
<li>You have to articulate your own principles, so that you can defend yourself against others’ taking inappropriate advantage of you, and so that you are secure and safe while you work and play.</li>
<li>You must discipline yourself carefully.</li>
<li>You must keep the promises you make to yourself, and reward yourself, so that you can trust and motivate yourself.</li>
<li>You need to determine how to act toward yourself so that you are most likely to become and to stay a good person.</li>
<li>You could begin by treating yourself as if you were someone you were responsible for helping.</li>
</ul>

<p>To treat yourself as if you were someone you are responsible for helping is, instead, to consider what would be truly good for you. This is not &ldquo;what you want.&rdquo; It is also not &ldquo;what would make you happy.&rdquo; Every time you give a child something sweet, you make that child happy. That does not mean that you should do nothing for children except feed them candy… You must help a child become a virtuous, responsible, awake being, capable of full reciprocity—able to take care of himself and others, and to thrive while doing so. Why would you think it acceptable to do anything less for yourself?</p>

<h4 id="rule-1-stand-up-straight-with-your-shoulders-back">Rule 1: Stand up straight with your shoulders back</h4>

<p>Standing up means voluntarily accepting the burden of being. You respond to a challenge, instead of bracing for a catastrophe.</p>

<p>Standing up straight with your shoulders back is not something that is only physical, because you are not only a body. You are a spirit!</p>

<p>Thus emboldened, you will embark on the voyage of your life, let your light shine and pursue your destiny! Then you may be able to accept the terrible burden of the World, and find joy.</p>

<p>My first book I have read on financial literacy! It is a life-changing book for me. Now I have desire, passion, and interest to invest in learning about finance. My goal is to invest money by myself instead of a financial advisor. I believe it is never too late to start investment by myself!</p>

<li>The rich don&rsquo;t work for money</li>
<li>Most people only talk and dream of getting rich. We need action.</li>
<li>Opportunities come and go. Being able to know when to make quick decisions is an important skill!</li>
<li>True learning takes energy, passion, and a burning desire.

<ul>
<li>Financial literacy</li>
<li>Understanding the market</li>
<li>Train your mind and courage and practice. Remember to have fun.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of losing, because failure is part of the process of success.</li>

Chapter 7 is alson an important chapter that needs to read again. It is about testing Terrform code (TerraTest).</p>

<h1 id="the-thorn-birds">The Thorn Birds</h1>

<p>The Thorn Birds is a 1977 best-selling novel by the Australian author Colleen McCullough.
In 1983, the novel was adapted into a television series also called The Thorn Birds.</p>

<p>In the front matter of the book, the myth is set out:</p>

<p>There is a legend about a bird which sings just once in its life, more sweetly than any other creature on the face of the earth. From the moment it leaves the nest it searches for a thorn tree, and does not rest until it has found one. Then, singing among the savage branches, it impales itself upon the longest, sharpest spine. And, dying, it rises above its own agony to out-carol the lark and the nightingale. One superlative song, existence the price. But the whole world stills to listen, and God in His heaven smiles. For the best is only bought at the cost of great pain&hellip;. Or so says the legend.</p>

<p>Chapter 1</p>

<p>Today was Maggie’s birthday and she got a surprise beautiful doll gift from her mom. From here, the book started to introduce each family member - a couple with 6 kids and Maggie was the youngest one and only daughter in the family. </p>

<p>Reading was the entrance into a world so fascinating!
Envy = jealous</p>

<p>8/30/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>“Wild” - a best non-fiction book of year 2012. I bought this ebook a few years ago but I didn’t get a chance to read it yet. Sometimes, I think borrowing a book from a library is better than bought a book by yourself because it pushes you to finish reading before the deadline. Fortunately, I am a member of the Tomato Group now so that it encourages me to keep reading books that I am interested in and no matter where I am and in what time zone. </p>

<p>Wild is a memoir. The author was from lost to found on the Pacific Creat Trail (PCT). She hiked 1100 miles as a journey of self-discovery. Sometimes, we may need to change or adjust ourselves in order to keep our position energy and be grateful for our life.</p>

<p>Oh, I did remember that I was touched when watching the movie in a flight that I couldn’t remember where I went to on the flight, and I expect to watch it again after reading this book!</p>

WILD 
Chapter 1: The Ten Thousand Things</p>

<p>Her solo three-month hike on PCT had many beginnings - quitting her job as a waitress, finalizing her divorce, selling almost everything she owned, and then shopping, packing, preparing to do it!</p>

<p>What caused her to make the decision? In her first chapter, she described her family, how she was raised up,  and more important was that her mother passed away that broke her up and cut her off. So she wanted the things to be different than they were before. So she decided to hike from Mojave desert, California to the Bridge of the Gods, Washington by herself. </p>

<p>9/3/2019  🍅打卡
WILD
Chapter 2 - Splitting</p>

<p>At a hot summer night, she checked in a motel where it was just miles away from the PCT trail. The front desk asked her the resident address but she wasn’t sure where she would live afterward&hellip; it sounds pretty sad when I read here but I think she is a strong woman. She would find something to do to get rid of her suffer. She was alone but she set up a short term goal. She needed time to change and to find her lost!</p>

<p>9/4/2019 🍅打卡
WILD 
Chapter 3 - Hunching in a Remotely Upright Position</p>

<p>When she leaned into the mirror and stared into her own eyes, she described at herself as “the woman with the hole in her heart”! That is why she decided to hike along for three months on the PCT. </p>

<p>In this chapter, she described all of her hiking gears. REI is a great store for hiking and climbing gears and people who work there are knowledgeable so you can consult before you buy anything. We usually buy our hiking shoes from REI because we need new pairs of hiking shoes for every two or three years. </p>

<p>9/7/2019 🍅打卡
WILD
Chapter 4 - the PCT, Volume 1: California </p>

<p>She bought the book of The Pacific Crest Trail, Volume 1: California from the REI and read it a dozen times over a few months. She got the thought about the PCT would make her to find her strength back!</p>

<p>It was 12 miles from the motel where she stayed for the overnight to the PCT trailhead. She planned to start from here, so she did hitchhiking in the hot June day in the desert with a heavy backpack in order to save her energy for her long backpacking trail. </p>

<p>The first steps down the trail was to the brown metal box to register. She read the names and notes from the previous hikers in the weeks ahead of her, most of them men traveling in pairs, no one of them was a woman alone. However, she knew there was nothing to do but go!</p>

<p>WILD
Chapter 5 - Tracks
She planned 14 miles a day over her trip but she just did 1 mile per hour for 9 hours a day in her first couple of days. She reached the first water source in her third day. She used her purifier pumped the water from the Golden Oak Springs. She refilled the bottles and bag that was totally 25 pounds. The next water source was 19 miles away. I never did backcountry hiking. I couldn’t imagine if I could walk with 25 lbs of  water. I do day hiking but I don’t carry a backpack at all because my husband carry’s everything for us.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 - a bull in both directions</p>

<p>Cheryl met another hiker, a refrigerator size bear, and a coiled up snake on PCT trail. So far she had been hiked for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>Chapter 7 - the only girl in the woods</p>

<p>Cheryle made it to her first stop - Kennedy Meadows. She picked up her supply at the General Store.</p>

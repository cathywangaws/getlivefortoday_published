<strong>How you read matters</strong>
Are you taking notes? Are you integrating what you read? You are not just filling shelves on the wall. <strong>You are trying to learn so that you can lead.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What books have changed your life?</strong>
Once a while, I should recall the books I read and ask myself this question. I should focus of my energy on books that will stay with me after I put them down. Reading is also a shortcut. A way to get where I want to get without having to learn by painful trail and error. It saves me!</p>

<p>Reading is the shortest path to self-improvement.</p>

<h2 id="how-to"><strong>How to</strong></h2>

<ul>
<li>Find the right books to read depending on my goals.

<ul>
<li>My reading goal for year 2020 is: AWS Cert, Investment, Others</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Create a personal library that will keep me on track.

<ul>
<li>I will get some ideas about how to track my readings from &ldquo;Goodreads&rdquo; app</li>

</ul>

<p>Warren Buffett has said that reading is the most valuable investment he&rsquo;s ever made.

<p><strong>Factufulness</strong></p>

<p>Somebody was reading this book and shared some content in WeChat Reading club that I feel it is interesting so I captured them here.</p>

<li>The goal of higher income is not just bigger piles of money. The goal of longer lives is not jsut extra time. <strong>The ultimate goal is to have the freedom to do what we want.</strong></li>
<li>It wasn&rsquo;t because humans lived in balance with nature. Humans died in balance with nature. It was utterly brutal and tragic.</li>

<p><strong>Grand Teton National Park - Unusual and beloved natural wonders</strong></p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/31.jpeg" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>This book has only 32 pages with beautiful photos. Glad I finished the reading on my morning train. I like to see these beautuful photos.</p>

<p>A national park is an area of land that has been set aside by congress. National parks protect nature and history.</p>

<p><strong>2019-08-17</strong></p>

<p>Since this year, I joined the book clubs that encourage me to read books. I always like learning something new because I hate to waste my time. I have been reading few books so far and I am feeling great. Sometimes, reading can fulfill your empty mind.</p>

<p>The WeChat reading group has created 3 new sub-groups, about travel, about book, and about finance. I joined 2 of them and somehow I feet I get distracted from my focus. People in the book group read all kind of books so I always think which book I should read next. Now I start to think I shouldn’t rush. <strong>I should focus on the books I read and summarize them and find out what I can learn from the books.</strong> This is should be my reading goal. Other people’s speed shouldn’t impact me. I should be calm and just follow my pace. I like travel and hiking so I will still focus on travel books.</p>

<p>I also like biography. So I should pick few books and read few times to understand their life. I had been read Babara Walters, Steve Jobs, Lincoln, Michelle Obama and now I am listening Onward. Each person has their own characters and I want to get inspired by them and improve myself or make my mind sharp.</p>

<p>I have been travel so many places in recent 10 years luckily. So now I start thinking to write my travel journeys. It is not only remember where I have been but inspire my life and look forward to next destination with my heart. When I travel, I want to feel the mother nature, get touched by local history or people etc.</p>

<p>In WeChat travel group, a guy with his girl friend traveled for 18 month in the world. They like adventures, music, and culture. I hope I can learn something from his journeys.</p>

<hr />

<p>Andy bought this book for me when we went to a Japanese supermarket. Hopefully I can make some dishes from this book. They look very tempting.

<p>This is an electronic book that talks about a resolve to live life to the fullest from small to big things. Essentially, YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, is about experiences not places. These experiences will replay in your mind years later, they will bring a smell to your face!</p>

<p><strong>6/22/2019 XiaoXi’s Birthday Party</strong></p>

<p>Went to Xiaoxi’s birthday party yesterday and met the hostess of reading club on Wechat. I admire her because she reads many books and able to share her thoughts after reading on WeChat. She must spend lot of timing on reading beside her busy job. She works for an investment and advising bank. She said she works a lot of overtime for her clients’ projects. However, she still has time to share her ideas and reading experience with us. So far, her reading club has 180 members.</p>

<p><strong>6/23/2019 Sunday</strong></p>

<p>Today, I watch one of her videos about bullet journal – zen style. It inspires me to use a bullet journal now. I like write down everything by hand. I am still not used to use onenote or word document to keep track my daily progress. I have difficulty to find my previous notes in a e-file document. Here is little summary that I learned from the Bullet Journal video.</p>

<p>Bullet Journal is organized in cohesive. First of all, you need a note book. There are 3 major components in a bullet journal – symbols, scheduling, indexing.</p>

<p>At the end of each day, go through every bullet. Put cross in the circle that presents it is done. Strike line presents the event/task is not happened. Put &gt; presents it is rescheduled, etc. To make sure nothing is forgotten.</p>

<p>Symbols (task-square, event-circle, Note-dash, Rescheduled to a later date-Greater than(&gt;), Postponed but date TBD-less than(&lt;))</p>

<p>Indexing: project log, daily log, ideas etc that is at first page in your journal book.</p>

<p>I didn’t have time to attend the Book Club Event at work since I was so stressful on AWS AMI Factory Project. I felt bad about it. Wish I could go and listen about what other people to think about Becoming! Here are some quotes from others:</p>

<p>It’s okay to swerve and be flexible – it opens you up to things you may not have originally considered.</p>

<p>Find what you love – then go do it!</p>

<p>Stay true to yourself, don’t compromise – people can tell when you’re faking it!</p>

<p>Giving back to the community in various ways – finding fulfillment in more than just the everyday “work.”</p>

<p>Find a mentor or sponsor – getting feedback and honing your skills is the key to continuous (personal) development.</p>

<p>My commitment is to never ask a person where they want to be in 10 years (or 5) again – it locks you in to a plan, and you could miss out on something exciting and unexpected.</p>

<p><strong>3/23/2019</strong></p>

<p>Passed the AWS Practitioner Exam after 2 weeks tense study. The questions were not easy at I thought of. Each question was kind of case study. If you had done or did some labs, you should have a correct answer. Some of questions kept asking repeatedly but in different ways. I was confused. I thought I would failed at the end because questions were little tricky. I spent first hour to finish all 65 questions and then I went through all questions again and changed couple of answers. So I used all 90 mins for the exam.</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/48.jpeg" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>I just bought this book and I am going to read it. This is recommended by the company book club. Also this is about real stories that sounds interested to me! It is a thick book and I hope I will find my time to read it through by the end of March.</p>

<p>2/21/2019 This Chinese book club is not really what I expected. At the end of January, I was expecting people would start talk about the book. However, nothing happened. I didn’t finish reading this book because it is little boring to me. It tells you how to be mindful. It sounds like meditation for me. I don’t really want to do it yet.</p>

<p>Joined a virtual book club at the beginning of this year. This book club will read a book each month and then we will discuss the book online. I ordered the book from Amazon and will read it before the deadline.</p>

<p><strong>Rocky Mountains</strong></p>

<p>8/11/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>Picked this travel book today</p>

<p>8/12/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>Of the hundreds of national parks scattered around the world, Banff, created in 1885, is the 3rd oldest NP. Some countries protect ancient ruins and medieval castles, the Rocky Mountains offer natural wonders. Walking along a well maintained trail is one of life’s great spiritual amusement.</p>

<p>No matter where you travel in the parks, there is a trail nearby that will lead you up spectacular mountains, into picturesque forests or down a dramatic gorge. The Rockies are hikers’ destinations!</p>

<p>8/13/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>Trails:</p>

<p>Plain of Six Glaciers + Lake Agnes &amp; the Beehives</p>

<p>Duration: 5 + 4 hours round-trip</p>

<p>Distance: 8.4 + 6.6 miles</p>

<p>Difficulty: Moderate</p>

<p>Start/Finish: Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise</p>

<p>Elevation Change: 1600ft</p>

<p>A classic and popular trail that is ending at a historic teahouse with views across the Victoria and Lefroy Glaciers. It is a jaw-dropper of a hike that’ll leave you breathless in more ways than one.</p>

<p>Follow the paved shoreline walk from the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise for 1.3 miles to the lake’s end, then head along the edge of the river flats, watching as the glacial creek feeding the lake becomes a torrent. The trail climbs steadily through forest, emerging occasionally to give you views of the glacial ravine. At the 2-mile mark and again at the 2.5-mile mark, you’ll meet trails branching off to the right, leading to the highline trail to the Big Beehive and Lake Agnes. Ignore these and press on up the valley, as the tree cover gradually thins out and you emerge onto switchbacks. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to stop and catch your breath, as well as to gaze at the rapidly approaching glaciers to the southwest and the ice-strewn slopes of Mts Lefroy and Victoria. Keep your ears open for the rumble of avalanches crashing off the distant Victoria Glacier, especially late in the morning. After 2 hours and 3.4 miles of climbing, you’ll reach the Plain of Six Glaciers Teahouse, constructed in 1927 as a way station for Swiss mountaineering guides leading clients up to the summit of Mt Victoria. Nestled in a quiet glade, the twin-level log chalet looks like something out of the pages of Heidi, and dishes up homemade cakes and gourmet teas to a steady stream of puffed-out hikers.</p>

<p>Despite its allure, sensible walkers leave the treats of the teahouse for the return walk, as the main hike isn’t over yet. From the clearing, the trail leads a further 1 mile uphill to the Plain of Six Glaciers itself, tracking a rubbly ridge that can be slippery in wet weather and is exposed to vicious winds funneled up the valley. Although there’s nothing to mark it, you’ll know you’ve reached the lookout when you have a grandstand view of the front edge of the Victoria Glacier and can see back down the valley to Lake Louise and the chateau. Once you’ve admired the views, retrace your steps down the moraine and visit the teahouse before heading back down the valley.</p>

<p>If your legs are up to it, you could detour along the signposted highline trail, which links up with the route to the Big Beehive and Lake Agnes. On the way back to trailhead, you can refuel yourself at the glassy surface of Mirror Lake that famous for its photogenic reflection of the Big Beehive.</p>

<p>Whistlers Summit Trail at Jasper NP</p>

<p>Duration: 3.5 hours one-way
Distance: 4.9 miles
Difficulity: Difficult
Start Trailhead: on Whistlers Rd
Finish Summit: Whistlers Mountain
Elevation Change: 4125ft</p>

<p>If you’rea a peak-bagger, this arduous climb through 3 different life zones to the top of Jasper’s most visited summit – and a handy energy-refueling cafe – could be the lung-bursting wake-up call you’ve been waiting for. While most sane people get the Skytram, there are always one or two masochistic maniacs punishing themselves on this uphill slog.</p>

<p>To get to the trailhead, proceed 1.7 miles down Whistlers Rd to a short, unpaved spur road on the left, which dead-ends in a small parking lot. the hike begins in what is known as the montane life zone of the mountain, consisting of thick forest and healthy aspen growth but, within 1.2 miles, your uphill endeavors will be rewardedd with a rich display of colorful wildflowers. Progressing up toward the treeline, the crippling switchbacks ease momentarily as you pass underneath the midpoint tower of the Jasper Skytram at approximately 5380ft of elevation.</p>

<p>Above the treeline the landscape becomes ever more stony and barren, with eagle-eye views of the Athabasca Valley and Jasper Town unfolding like a satelite map beneath you. For the final 0.9 miles, from the Skytram’s upper terminal to the top,you should have plenty of company, as annoyingly fresh Skytram riders join in for the relatively undemanding dash for the 8088ft summit. The stupendous views of lake-speckled valleys and row after row of endless snowcoated peaks are spellbinding.</p>

<p>Paperback 260 pages / Published at 2017</p>

<p>This book was recommended by the WeChat Reading Group. Negotiation is everywhere. It says <strong>LIFE IS NEGOTIATION</strong>. So I got interested to know about it. How to use negotiation tactics in my daily life.</p>

<p>7/18/2019 @ 11:50am / Page 1 – 27</p>

<p>Negotiations are everywhere in our life. An FBI agent wrote this book to talk about negotiation tactics. Chris said he’s never experienced a hostage situation so tense, so personal. I think I am a moody person. I hope I can learn few negotiation tactics from Chris and use them at work and at daily life.</p>

<p>7/20/2019 @ 2:30pm / Page 28 – 40</p>

<p>Basic problem solving tactics in a negotiation are:- calm people down- establish rapport – gain trust- elicit the verbalization of needs- persuade the other guy of our empathy.</p>

<p>Dealing with people, you have to get a communication channel with them. Also let them know you care about them so they can trust you and be able to talk their needs and thoughts. Once you understand them, you can use your tactics to solve problems.</p>

<p>7/21/2019 @ 5:00pm / Chapter 1</p>

<p>Chris Voss who is the author had spent more than two decades in the FBI and he is the only one that lead international kidnapping negotiation! He wrote this book based on his years of experiences and principles to teach us LIFE IS NEGOTIATION!</p>

<p>In the early 1980s, there were some negotiation skills, for example, problem-solving, bargaining, getting to yes, but they didn’t work after awhile.</p>

<p>This book introduces Tactical Empathy approach. It will teach how to use deep understanding of human psychology to negotiate a lower car price, a bigger raise, and reclaim control of the conversations that inform your life and career. It will also teach how to use emoticons, instincts, and insights in any encounter to connect better with others, influence them, and achieve more.
Negotiation simply means playing the emotional game that human society is set up for. In this world, you get what you ask for; you just have to ask correctly!</p>

<p>7/22/2019 @ 7:00pm / Page 54 – 77</p>

<p>There are 3 type of voice:</p>

<p>– Late-midnight FM DJ voice</p>

<p>– Positive voice</p>

<p>– Direct voice</p>

<p>Positive voice is the voice of an easygoing, good-natured person and the attitude is light and encouraging. When we negotiate with your counterpart, you use positive voice with smile. Your counterpart will think more quickly and more collaborative because you make your counterpart’s mind positive. So smile on your face and on your voice when you bargain in s street market! You will get what you want!</p>

<p>7/23/2019 @ 5:00pm / Page 78 – 104</p>

<p>Mirror is another negotiation skill. It means you repeat the last three words of what your counterpart just said.  Mirror gives you ability to disagree without disagreeable!</p>

<p>Using mirror is better than asking why. Mirror shows your respect and concern for what other person is saying.</p>

<p>If we can use this tactic at work, we would reduce conflict with colleagues and also let them agree with us! Sounds simple but needs practice.
Mirroring will make you feel awkward when you first try it. That is the only hard part about it. Don’t be shy to practice! Once you get used to it, you will be success!</p>

<p>“Each day means a new twenty-four hours. Each day means everything’s possible again. You live in the moment, you die in the moment, you take it all one day at a time.” – from Legend book</p>

<p>7/24/2019 @ 5pm / Chapter 2</p>

<p>This chapter used the bank robbery as an example to teach us how to negotiate with others. Here are some keys:
– Slow it down. If you are in hurry, people can feel that you are not listening. Otherwise, the rapport will be gone.
– Put smile on your face when you talk. People can collaborate quickly with you.
– Mirroring and silence. Repeat the last three words of what people says. Silence for at least four seconds. Together work magic on your counterpart.
– Listening. It makes the other party feel a sense of trust.</p>

Empathy is the ability to experience the feelings of another person. It goes beyond sympathy, which is caring and understanding for the suffering of others. Both words are used similarly and often interchangeably (incorrectly so) but differ subtly  巧妙的 in their emotional meaning.</p>

<p>Andy @7/26/2019 Chapter 3</p>

<p>It is good to always remember the below three items at work:
Emotions were just an obstacle to a good outcome,
Once people get upset at one another, rational thinking goes out the window.
talking less, and listening more.</p>

<p>Ignoring others’ feelings only build up frustration, and make them less likely to do what you want.
The opposite of that is tactical empathy:
Empathy – paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling, and making a commitment to understanding their world.
Tactical Empathy – it is one step beyond.
understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment and also hearing what is behind those feels so we increase your influence.
换位思考，了解对方的感受，替对方着想，容易达到双赢的局面 – empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It’s about understanding them
articulate what they did – 阐明他们所做的
 “A few years ago during a speech at Georgetown University, Clinton advocated, “showing respect, even for one’s enemies. Trying to understand and, insofar as psychologically possible, empathize with their perspective and point of view.”</p>

<p>7/27/2019 / Chapter 3: Empathy</p>

<p>Empathy is the ability to understand how someone is feeling, not the ability to feel that feeling with other person.
Tactical empathy is not only underrated the feelings but mindset of another and also hearing what is behind those feelings.</p>

<p>The process is called LABELING. Labeling has advantage when your counterpart is tense and emotional. First step of labeling is detecting the other person’s emotional state. Once you’ve spotted an emotion you need to highlight that lead you to the next step which is label it aloud. Make your sentence starts with: it looks like…, it seems like…, it sounds like…. Do not use “I’m hearing that…”. When you say “I”, it says you are more interested in yourself than the other person and the offense they might cause.
If they disagree with the label, you can always step back and say, “I didn’t say that was what it was. I just said it seems like that.” The last step of labeling is silence. Once you’ve thrown out a label, be quiet and listen.</p>

<p>Chapter 4: Master “No”</p>

<p>Good negotiators know that their job isn’t to put a great performance but to guide their counterpart to discover their goal as his own. But how?
By using a question that prompts a “No” answer, and your counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved that he is in the driver’s side, then talking starts.
For the other side to say “No” has an amazing power to bring down barriers and allow for beneficial communication. negotiators would control the situation and finish up the negotiation with a “Yes”.
Using this chapter’s skills in daily life is difficult but don’t be afraid to give it a try!</p>

<p>Chapter 5:</p>

<p>During negotiation, get “yes” means nothing without “how”.
Driving toward “that’s right” is a winning strategy in all negotiations. But hearing “you’re right” is a disaster.
After listening and talking during negotiation, you can summarize what your counterpart says in order to get “that is right” that is a breakthrough and gain trust.
Use THAT IS RIGHT can make your career success. For example, a salesman can use this tactic. Another example, during an interview, ask questions to get “that is right” answer from interviewers.</p>

<p>8/1/2019 Chapter 6</p>

<p>This chapter has a great example about how to negotiate a better salary with the boss.
1. Be pleasant persistent non-salary terms. This is can crest empathy with the boss and build an environment for discussion. It they can’t meet your non-salary requests, they may counter with more money.
2. Spark their interest in your success. Sale yourself and sale your success. Ask “what does it take to be successful here?”. Then pause and let the boss talks. After that, use labeling that starts with “it sounds like…” to emphasize the situation.</p>

<p>8/6/2019Chapter 7</p>

<p>If you can’t control your emotions. How can you expect to influence of emotions of another party?
This is my weakness. I am a moody person. I don’t usually control my emotions. Actually I never think I need to control my emotions. If others make me angry, I would walk away instead of argue with the person.
This chapter teaches you to use previous chapter tactics to control yourself. Mindfully change your state to something positive.
Chapter 8Ask “how” questions to direct the other party to your way. Don’t ask “why” questions!
Don’t use “No”. Use “how am I supposed to gather that much money in a short period of time?” Instead. This question indicates the willingness but asks for a help finding a way to do it.</p>

<p>When your counterpart answers, you summarize them until you get “that is right”.
Then you win the negotiation.
Well, saying them is easy. It is very difficult to implement them in your daily life.
I have learned many tactics so far from this book, but I haven’t used any of them yet. I don’t know how to start when I talk with a person!</p>

<p>8/10/2019Chapter 9</p>

<p>“The single biggest thing you can do is to smile when you speak. People will be more forthcoming with information to you as a result. Smiling can also become a habit that makes it easy for you to mask any moments you’ve been caught off guard.”</p>

<p>8/11/2019Chapter 10</p>

<p>“fear of conflict and encourages you to navigate it with empathy. If you’re going to be great at anything—a great negotiator, a great manager, a great husband, a great wife—you’re going to have to do that. You’re going to have to ignore that little genie who’s telling you to give up, to just get along—as well as that other genie who’s telling you to lash out and yell.”
“Every negotiation, every conversation, every moment of life, is a series of small conflicts that, managed well, can rise to creative beauty. – Embrace them”</p>

<p>This book teaches many negotiation tactics which hard to use them in your life. However, the author recommends that don’t be afraid to practice them in reality. You may feel awkward at the beginning but you will get confidence when you get used to it.</p>

<p>At the end of this book, it gives a summary:</p>

<p>Negotiation is a psychological investigation. It is a list of tools, such as labeling and mirroring, customized to the particular negotiation.</p>

<p>Set up a reasonable goal and define it clearly. Write it down.
Summary (summarize a situation what your counterpart will respond with a “That is right”)
Labels (for example, it seems like you didn’t like…, it seems like … is valuable for you)
Calibrate questions means “what” and “how” questions. Don’t ask “why” question.</p>

<p><strong>In Shock</strong></p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/InShock_01.jpeg" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>In Shock: My Journey from Death to Revocery and the Redemptive Power of Hope by Rana Awdish.</p>

<p>After writing the book, Dr. Awdish has devoted much of her career to improving empathy through connection and communication.</p>

<p>The book discussion will be led by Jacqui Key, managing director of Airport Operations Domestic Line Stations. Jacqui likes the book because it humanizes doctors and shows that being a patient can change perspectives. “I think we can relate that to our everyday lives and daily interactions,” she says.</p>

<p>This book was selected for 2nd quarter reading book by uRead club. I bought this hardcover book from Amazon at April 30, 2019.</p>

<p>redemptive = acting to save someone from error or evil. 救赎</p>

<p>humanize = make more humane or civilized.</p>

<p>After reading this book, I think Dr Dana was lucky. She is a doctor so she gets treatments right away. If this happened to a regular patient, doctors won’t care too much except regular treatment. Just like Dr Dana said in the book, other patients who had same disease died but she was survived. She is a doctor so she knows what was wrong about her body so she helped herself on treatment and she even guided other doctors about how to cure her disease.</p>

<p>After she went back to work after she got recovered from her sickness, she has empathy for her patients and she started to treat her patients with extra care and encourage them to fight with their disease as well. So I think these patients got her treatment were lucky.</p>

<p>I hope all doctors would look like her. When a person gets sick, he or she gets lot of pressure and worries. The patients consider doctors are their hope.</p>

<p>I went to the uRead club and listened other people’s discussion. However, they didn’t talk about the book too much. Most of time, they just talked about their working stories, a lady was very emotional. She even cried when she talked about a passenger’s story. Every passenger has a story. If she knows all of them, she would cry all the time. Is it professional? Should we separate our mood from work?</p>

<p>7/12/2019</p>

<p>I mailed the book of In shock to Karen in MI since she also likes real stories and biographies. So I recommended her to read this book and then share her summary with Tomato Group members. In this way, I also can learn what she will find out from this book! This is her first post in the WeChat.</p>

<p><sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>2019</sub> from Karen</p>

<p>Karen told me this book is hard to follow that I agree with her. Dr Dana is not only talk about her disease but also her thoughts. So both were mixed in her book and it hard for us to follow her stories in the book. Also this book has many medical terms that we don’t understand that caused us understanding issue.</p>

<p>I hope Karen won’t give it up and she can finish reading the book on her own pace. She doesn’t have to share with others.</p>

<p>Paperback, 9th Edition, 264 pages / Published June 21, 2016</p>

<p>I picked this book because it is an easy reading book and I am interested in travel.</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/Rio.jpeg" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>6/28/2019 Friday</p>

<p>Brazil doesn’t need eVisa since middle of June this year so I started to get interested to know sth about Brazil. Rio, Brazil is a very popular vacation destination in South America. So I borrowed this book from the library and wanted to check out if there are sth that could catch my eyes. Also I think it is an easy reading book with lot of pictures. It would be a good start point for Tomato Group reading.</p>

<p>6/28/2019 &amp; 2:50pm</p>

<p>Page 1-12Rio, Brazil is a vacation destination. The statue of Christ is one of new 7 wonders of the world!</p>

<p>6/29/2019 @ 6:54 Colorado time</p>

<p>Rio is famous at Carnaval and samba music!</p>

<p>6/30/2019 @ 11:00</p>

<p>Christ the Redeemer Statue is Rio’s most identifiable landmark and is considered to be the world’s largest Art Deco statue.</p>

<p>8/4/2019 Sunday</p>

<p>Rio is a small city in Brazil with lot of tourists. It is a well developed city for visitors. If I would like to take a vacation, I would prefer to go to a remote place to breath fresh air. This popular destination is not my type of vacation place so it is not on my buck list after reading this book.</p>

<p><strong>Dreamland</strong></p>

<p>Dreamland: The True Tale of America’s Opiate Epidemic by Sam Quinones.</p>

<p>Paperback, 384 pages / Published April 21, 2015</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/Dreamland.jpeg" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>7/1/2019 Monday</p>

<p>Starting reading this new book. This book is recommended by the company uRead club and we will review the book at the end of the 3rd quarter of this year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the WeChat Reading Group also established a Tomato Group. Each group is about 10 people. First of all, take a picture with the book that book can be printed, audio, or anything. Then you need to read the book for 25 minutes a day and write a brief summary. Each 14-days is a period.</p>

<p>This book is about how bad of opiate addiction.</p>

<p>Dreamland 7/2/2019 @ 4:20pm</p>

<p>This book is true story telling. Every couple of pages is a story that tells how a young guy overdose heroin and died and how the drug business going into US. These stories are sad but true crimes. What does Dreamland refer to in this book? I have to continue to read to find out…</p>

<p>Dreamland 7/3/2019 @ 6:00pm</p>

<p>Today I learned how the morphine is different from other drugs. Other drugs are easily reduced to water-soluble glucose in the human body, which then expels them, so you won’t get addicted. Alone in nature, the morphine resisted being turned into glucose and it stays in the body. So morphine creates higher tolerance!</p>

<p>Dreamland 7/4/2019 @ 8pm New York time</p>

<p>Poppy flowers look very pretty. The color can be orange, yellow, or red. They are easy to grow. Poppies died after flower season. However, one kind of poppies is source of opium…</p>

<p>Dreamland 7/5/2019 @ 1pm New York time</p>

<p>Poppies are easier grow than sugarcane in Mexico. The author is Mexican American so he focused on Mexico and US stories in this book. There is one small village in Northern Mexico in 1960s where they planed poppies and then made black tar and solid heroin.</p>

<p>Dreamland 7/6/2019 @ 3:30pm</p>

<p>The book describes drug business just likes pizza business. A pizza store makes pizza, get an order by a phone call, and then go out to delivery! Heroin is made in a small village, Mexico, a dealer who is called cell gets an order by a call, then arrange a driver to deliver it to the customer!</p>

<p>Dreamland 7/7/2019 @ 3:20pm</p>

<p>In 1990s, drug dealers were called traffickers. They usually worked for couple of months in US and then went back to their hometown in Mexico where was their dreamland with cash for building new houses and gifts for relatives.</p>

<p>Dreamland7/8/2019 @ 4:10pm</p>

<p>These dealers from Mexico are about 19 to 35 years old. Usually their families or relatives run a business together. They are farmer boys but they are polite to their customers so their customers are hardly to hate them even though they get addicted from heroin!</p>

<p>Dreamland7/9/2019 @ 8:45pm</p>

<p>From the world wide, doctors and researchers in hospital and laboratory keep to find nonaddictive medicine for painkiller.</p>

<p>Dreamland7/10/2019 @ 4:20pm</p>

<p>In Portsmouth, Ohio, a doctor abused drug medicine. He prescribed the drugs to his patients without asking patients’ pain history. So his clinic was always full with addicted patients and he only accepted cash . He ran his clinic for decades until some people got complaints and finally the medical license board terminated his license and he got more punishment!</p>

<p>Dreamland7/11/2019 @ 4:30pm</p>

<p>Columbus, Ohio has been known as “the test-market capital of the United States in 1990s! Marketers use Columbus as a barometer of America. Fast-food chains headquarter there, like White Castle, Wendy’s, Panera. They have used the town to gauge interest in new products. McDonalds tested its McRib in Columbus. A CBS reporter said “what they choose in Columbus today may very well determine what you will buy tomorrow.” It seems an interesting city for me. I will probably stop by to find out some new products that haven’t been available in other cities yet in my next road trip!</p>

<p>Dreamland7/12/2019 @ 5:00pm</p>

<p>Nayarit is a small village at west coast of Mexico. Since the warm weather, they have sugarcane field but profit is very low. Young people who live over there consider America is their dreamland. Mexican always know each other very well and they have a lot cousins. If one cousin came to US, others will come eventually. They all had a same goal in 1990s that was save money and then sent back home so their families could have better life in the village. Santa Fe, New Mexico was one of their destinations. They usually worked for 6 month and then went back home for parties, spending money on gifts, and building new houses. They would come back to US until their pockets were empty again. That was their life style but they seemed happy! Everyone has a different goal but the goal gets influenced by others! Therefore, when we make a new friend, we’d better to find same-class people.</p>

<p>Dreamland7/15/2019 @ 5:30pm</p>

<p>People came to US for better living and hoped their kids were happy to live in this dreamland. However, these parents couldn’t forget their culture and forced their kids to follow them so young kids started to against their parents in this book! This is a sad story but it makes readers to think why freedom doesn’t apply to everyone in this dreamland!</p>

<p>Dreamland7/16/2019 @ 5:00pm</p>

<p>“When you start into drugs, your emotional development gets stunted. Matt was twenty-one, but he was at the maturity level of middle-teen years. Drugs take away that ability to act emotionally mature. The drug becomes your god.”</p>

<p>Dreamland 7/17/2019 @ 4:34pm</p>

<p>The Tomato Group encourages me to read the book everyday so I could finish it up quickly. Most of time, I read the book on the train that is perfect time to me but I feel my eyes are tired after staring at computer for 8 hours.</p>

<p>The author interviewed drug dealers, addicts, doctors, researchers, and victim families. They were all true stories in the book. Usually addicts started from prescribed painkillers in 1990s and then moved to black tar heroin. They died when they overdose them! The book also described how the drug dealers operated the business. They sale them to white people and most of addicts were from middle-class families in US. At the end of the book, it says it is still going on…</p>

<p>What I learned from this book is we need to be careful about medicine. We need to know what the side affects are before we take them. If food can help then please avoid medicine. Also we need to do exercises regularly.</p>

<p>8/4/2019 Sunday @ 3:30pm</p>

<p>From this book, I learned what is heroin and how dealers sale them and where they come from. Dreamland is supposed to be a pure place for living but it ruined by addicted drugs that make addicts miserable. The book tells people that stay away from them. I wish the author would tell some stories about how to prevent to take them and how dealers should get punished.</p>

      <description>Today is mid-autumn festival in China. Today is also my wedding anniversary in US. Today is to remember!
We usually don&amp;rsquo;t celebrate our birthdays. We like to celebrate Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day instead.
Recently, I read a book and it says that treat today is your last day so you won&amp;rsquo;t waste your time! I am to a degree if it is a positive day.</description>

      <description>This party was finally over and got relief now. Hosting a party for soccer team is stressful than others because they are Andyâ€™s friends. We made food plan together and started to prepare it couple of days earlier in order to make sure the party would be successful.
Bought a box of frozen crab legs from Costco. We decided to serve them a seafood theme dinner.
Appetizers: fried tofu &amp;amp; wonton</description>

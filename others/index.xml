      <description>It is almost end of the year again. Time flies and I need to pause here and recall what have I done during year 2019.
Year 2019
 Starting reading books
 This is becoming a new hobby to me. I met a new friend who introduced me to join a reading club on WeChat. We were supposed to read a book each month. We just need to read 25 mins a day but we need to write down a summary after reading each day.</description>

      <description>10/23/2019
We got a room available for my mom in this senior house so we decided to go back to my hometown together.
The trip was smooth even though it was a long international trip from US to Canada to US to China. We had 4 connections. Andy and I didnâ€™t sleep too much during this trip because the schedule was very tight.</description>

      <description>Today is mid-autumn festival in China. Today is also my wedding anniversary in US. Today is to remember!
We usually don&amp;rsquo;t celebrate our birthdays. We like to celebrate Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day instead.
Recently, I read a book and it says that treat today is your last day so you won&amp;rsquo;t waste your time! I am to a degree if it is a positive day.</description>

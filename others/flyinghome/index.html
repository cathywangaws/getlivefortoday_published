<p>We got a room available for my mom in this senior house so we decided to go back to my hometown together.</p>

<p>The trip was smooth even though it was a long international trip from US to Canada to US to China. We had 4 connections. Andy and I didn’t sleep too much during this trip because the schedule was very tight.</p>

<p>Once we arrived at my hometown, we checked in the senior house at 10/25/2019 Friday (moving in and signing the 18 month contract).</p>

<p>2019/10/25 is HuiFang&rsquo;s Birthday too. It was a coincident. We went to a famous restaurant for celebrating both.</p>

<p><strong>8/9/2019</strong></p>

<p>My mom came back to Chicago with us at 7/14/2019. For so many years, I just live with Andy alone. So I am not get used to live with more person. Since her visit, my life is totally changed. I feel my house doesn’t belong to me and it is not organized very well. Living with one more person is not easy for me. I feel I lost my freedom. Each day, each week are tough to me.</p>

<p>We go out for dinner at Fridays that I don’t like restaurant food. I always feel gained lot of weight at next morning that make me sad.</p>

<p>6/1/2019 China</p>

<p>Andy and I decided to go back to China to visit few senior houses that recommended by my cousin and his wife. They spent their time to visit some of them and gave us the feedback. However, I think I need to see them in person because what I want doesn’t same about what they want. Everyone has his own preference.</p>

<p>First day, we visited 3 senior houses. Two are at suburbs that is about 2 hours away from the city by driving. We interviewed few seniors who live there and realized that they were not the place that we were looking for. We want a quiet place for living but it needs to be closer a hospital and also convenient for us to visit.</p>

<p>The third one was a brand new high-raised building in the city. It is not opened yet. So we just visited model rooms and the sale lady introduced their services to us. There is no space on the ground for seniors. They have to cross a street and go to a public park for exercise that I consider not safe for seniors. Even though the model room looks so cozy that just like a luxury hotel room and I couldn’t consider it is homey. So we passed this one too.</p>

<p>Overall, I got disappointed my first day visiting. I worried we may not able to find a place that  we like for my mom. I don’t know what would I do if I couldn’t find a good place for her.</p>

<p>Next day, we visited another senior house that is also recommended by a Andy’s classmate’s parent. They have living over there for more than a month and my mom also talked with them. However, when my mom talked with the salesman over the WeChat, their conversation wasn’t smooth. So my mom seems not like this place at all. I also though if the salesman has a bad service, how the senior house takes care about people. I was hesitated to see that place. We made an appointment with Andy’s friend’s parents and we brought gifts for them so we had to say thanks for their help in person that no matter we choose this place or not.</p>

<p>It was Tuesday 6/4/2019. It was a sunny day. Andy’s brother went there with us together. As soon as I entered the campus, I saw some seniors and 3 high raised building with clean campus. That impressed me at the first sight. Also the location is very good. It is about 45 mins from city center by driving and there is a brand new hospital near there.</p>

<p>We met the salesman in person. He looks friendly to us and he showed us rooms with detail information. When he talked over the phone with a customer, his attitude wasn’t bad based on my opinion. I started to like this place. He told me there are about 400 seniors who are living here now.</p>

<p>We went there at about 7:30am so we saw seniors at the campus. We talked with them and most of them have been living there for more than a year. One senior came back from America. Another couple came from a different city. Those seniors had very good career, like a lawyer, a doctor, a leader etc. They look like well educated seniors. That is the place I want my mom to live!</p>

<p>His name is Wei ZhiYuan. We were at the office to go through the paperwork. We need to put deposit for waiting list. We planned to move in at October, 2019. In order to build up a better relationship with him, I bought a bag of American chocolate at airport duty free store for him.</p>

<p>The minimum monthly fee is RMB 4500 per person that is not cheap and not every senior can afford it. So this also tells only seniors who had a good job with a good salary can live here.</p>

<p>Still now, not every Chinese family can accept their parents live in a senior house. They would think they couldn’t take care of them and get criticized by their friends so they will lose their face. Like my mom’s sister who is my aunt. Her son said she has to live with them even though they are very busy at work and most of time they are not at home so her son couldn’t take care of my aunt too much actually. However, this is culture thing!  It is about human mind and money associated with.</p>

<p>In the campus, they will build a pharmacy and a small out-patient hospital.</p>

<p>These pictures are about the living room and bedroom. The AC is in bedroom. All rooms face south that can get lot of sunlight daily and seniors like them.</p>

<p>This is a dinning table. They provide all furniture, like a laundry, sofa, microwave, electric stove, a full size refrigerator etc.</p>

<p>Another side of hallway is windows too. So the hallway looks brighter.</p>

<p>In each building, there is a nurse station.</p>

<p>We took a picture together with Andy’s friend’s parents who standing next to me (they were doctors) and a couple moved from Dalian city who have been living here for 1.5 years. They lived in a senior house in their hometown but they didn’t like to so moved here.</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Flying_Home/2019_77.jpeg" alt="Flying Home" title="Flying Home" /></p>

<p>The campus is big and clean. There is also a walking path with shade.</p>

<p>This is one of buildings. Also the owner is building another 6 new building to expand the business. So I believe it is a good place for seniors otherwise, there won’t have 400 people now. And all rooms are occupied so we have to waiting until a room is available.</p>

<p>This place is near shopping center and public transportation. Overall, I think it is a satisfied place for seniors.</p>

<p>I hope my mom will like there and will be able to consider there as her home. We will visit her couple of times a year so she won’t feel she is too far from her kids.</p>

<p>One of my cousin will be her direct guardian since he lives in the same city. He will give me a big help.</p>

<p><strong>5/30/2019</strong></p>

<p>My mom lives in Canada alone and she is getting older so she needs to care than before. She doesn’t have a US green card so she couldn’t live with me long term.</p>

<p>After discuss with my brother, we all agree my mom goes back to China and live in a senior house is a better solution for her.</p>

<p>Her kids live in US but she will go back to China. The situation is hard. She may feel lonely but she can’t live in Canada forever. She doesn’t speak English. She doesn’t eat western food. So all of these tell her that she needs to go back to China.</p>

<p>I don’t know what will happen after she moves back to China! It is a un-foreseen situation. We just know more and more seniors live in a senior house without living with their kids together.</p>

<p>5/26/2019</p>

<p>A family reunion! I am not sure when will be the next time! I haven’t seen my brother for years and I don’t miss him. He is a son but barely visit my mom.</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Flying_Home/2019_82.jpeg" alt="Flying Home" title="Flying Home" /></p>

<p>We went to Point Pelee National Park together for half day.</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Flying_Home/2019_83.jpeg" alt="Flying Home" title="Flying Home" /></p>

<p>9/15/2018</p>

<p>My mom came back from China after 5 month. I went to Windsor to see her. We haven’t been seen each other for almost 6 month. My feeling was complicated. She had a caregiver in China but she lives along without speaking English in Windsor. I am so worry about her now since she is getting old and I don’t know what I should do! She doesn’t want to move to US because no Medicare and we are not at home everyday. So she will be alone even though she lives with us.</p>

<p>When I saw my mom, I could feel her mind isn’t sharp like before. She kept repeating things and her moving is slower than before. When I saw these, my heart is almost broken because I don’t know how to take care of her now!</p>

<p>When I think about my mom, I start thinking about myself. Who will take care of me when I am at her age? I have no kids at all. My life will be very lonely! So I have to live for today. Enjoy everyday and be happy. Tomorrow will be a new day!</p>

<p>We had breakfast at our favorite place, Tim Hortons. Then we ran some errands together. Lunch at Flying Tiger Restaurant.</p>

<p>Then I cleaned up all windows and the rooms. Also reorganized some kitchen stuff. I just hope my mom has a quality life. She doesn’t eat too much but I want her to eat the freshest food.</p>

<p>so far, I just know I should see her more often than before. She needs me!</p>

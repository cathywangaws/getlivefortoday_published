          <p>Green Book, this is the first movie that I watched since this year. The film is inspired by the true story of a tour of the Deep South by Jamaican-American classical &amp; jazz pianist and Italian-American bounder who served as a driver &amp; bodyguard.</p>

<p>The film won the Oscar Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor and was also nominated for Best Actor and Best Film Editing. It is really a great story and make you thinking after you watch it.</p>

<p>The Green Book was a guide for African-American travelers to find motels, restaurants, and filling stations that would serve them.</p>

<p>This film is a biographical comedy drama film with a happy ending. Usually, a happy ending film has less chance to win a big Oscar award but this is exception.</p>

<p>This film is a story about friendship, character, dignity 尊严, and compassion 同情 between a well-educated pianist and a white driver. They have totally different background and they have their own issue as well. However, their friendship is built throughout. Their friendship is last until they die. It is really heartwarming story. I think both actor and supporting actor should win the Oscar awards. They both are great actors.</p>

<p>People need friendship and so I am. However, it became difficult in a real life. You keep things simple but others don’t! It is a great movie. It tells you sth about a life!</p>

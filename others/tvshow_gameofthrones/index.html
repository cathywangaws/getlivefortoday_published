<p>I  had been watching GOT all seasons 2 times. However, I still like it very much and now I start watching GOT from season 1 again. This time, I feel I could understand it better than last time. 7 Kingdoms, which one do I like most? The Queen, the dragon mother, Jon Snow? I have to think about it!</p>

<p>Tonight will have Game of Thrones season 8. This will be the last season of Game of Thrones. Lot of people are waiting for this season and I also subscribed HBO today so I will be able to watch it at 8pm tonight.</p>

<p>WINTER IS BACK – Game of Thrones &amp; Chicago heavy snow!</p>

<p>It has been April but today’s snow was still heavy about 3 inches. So I made snowmen at backyard.</p>

<p>We came back from LA. Our refrigerator was empty so we had to go out for food. The roads were covered with snow and even traffic lights can’t be seen at intersections. What a snow!</p>

<p>Since the weather was cloudy, we had Chinese hot pot at home. Simple and warm dinner. It is better than eating at a restaurant!</p>

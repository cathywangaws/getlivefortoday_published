<p><strong>Factufulness</strong></p>

<p>Somebody was reading this book and shared some content in WeChat Reading club that I feel it is interesting so I captured them here.</p>

<p>第一章： the world is no longer developed va developing. The gap instinct is the biggest misconception. The reality is often not polarized at all</p>

<ul>
<li>The goal of higher income is not just bigger piles of money. The goal of longer lives is not jsut extra time. <strong>The ultimate goal is to have the freedom to do what we want.</strong></li>
<li>It wasn&rsquo;t because humans lived in balance with nature. Humans died in balance with nature. It was utterly brutal and tragic.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Grand Teton National Park - Unusual and beloved natural wonders</strong></p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/31.jpeg" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>This book has only 32 pages with beautiful photos. Glad I finished the reading on my morning train. I like to see these beautuful photos.</p>

<p>A national park is an area of land that has been set aside by congress. National parks protect nature and history.</p>

<p><strong>2019-08-17</strong></p>

<p>Since this year, I joined the book clubs that encourage me to read books. I always like learning something new because I hate to waste my time. I have been reading few books so far and I am feeling great. Sometimes, reading can fulfill your empty mind.</p>

<p>The WeChat reading group has created 3 new sub-groups, about travel, about book, and about finance. I joined 2 of them and somehow I feet I get distracted from my focus. People in the book group read all kind of books so I always think which book I should read next. Now I start to think I shouldn’t rush. <strong>I should focus on the books I read and summarize them and find out what I can learn from the books.</strong> This is should be my reading goal. Other people’s speed shouldn’t impact me. I should be calm and just follow my pace. I like travel and hiking so I will still focus on travel books.</p>

<p>I also like biography. So I should pick few books and read few times to understand their life. I had been read Babara Walters, Steve Jobs, Lincoln, Michelle Obama and now I am listening Onward. Each person has their own characters and I want to get inspired by them and improve myself or make my mind sharp.</p>

<p>I have been travel so many places in recent 10 years luckily. So now I start thinking to write my travel journeys. It is not only remember where I have been but inspire my life and look forward to next destination with my heart. When I travel, I want to feel the mother nature, get touched by local history or people etc.</p>

<p>In WeChat travel group, a guy with his girl friend traveled for 18 month in the world. They like adventures, music, and culture. I hope I can learn something from his journeys.</p>

<hr />

<p>Andy bought this book for me when we went to a Japanese supermarket. Hopefully I can make some dishes from this book. They look very tempting.

<p>This is an electronic book that talks about a resolve to live life to the fullest from small to big things. Essentially, YOU ONLY LIVE ONCE, is about experiences not places. These experiences will replay in your mind years later, they will bring a smell to your face!</p>

<p><strong>6/22/2019 XiaoXi’s Birthday Party</strong></p>

<p>Went to Xiaoxi’s birthday party yesterday and met the hostess of reading club on Wechat. I admire her because she reads many books and able to share her thoughts after reading on WeChat. She must spend lot of timing on reading beside her busy job. She works for an investment and advising bank. She said she works a lot of overtime for her clients’ projects. However, she still has time to share her ideas and reading experience with us. So far, her reading club has 180 members.</p>

<p><strong>6/23/2019 Sunday</strong></p>

<p>Today, I watch one of her videos about bullet journal – zen style. It inspires me to use a bullet journal now. I like write down everything by hand. I am still not used to use onenote or word document to keep track my daily progress. I have difficulty to find my previous notes in a e-file document. Here is little summary that I learned from the Bullet Journal video.</p>

<p>Bullet Journal is organized in cohesive. First of all, you need a note book. There are 3 major components in a bullet journal – symbols, scheduling, indexing.</p>

<p>At the end of each day, go through every bullet. Put cross in the circle that presents it is done. Strike line presents the event/task is not happened. Put &gt; presents it is rescheduled, etc. To make sure nothing is forgotten.</p>

<p>Symbols (task-square, event-circle, Note-dash, Rescheduled to a later date-Greater than(&gt;), Postponed but date TBD-less than(&lt;))</p>

<p>Indexing: project log, daily log, ideas etc that is at first page in your journal book.</p>

<p>I didn’t have time to attend the Book Club Event at work since I was so stressful on AWS AMI Factory Project. I felt bad about it. Wish I could go and listen about what other people to think about Becoming! Here are some quotes from others:</p>

<p>It’s okay to swerve and be flexible – it opens you up to things you may not have originally considered.</p>

<p>Find what you love – then go do it!</p>

<p>Stay true to yourself, don’t compromise – people can tell when you’re faking it!</p>

<p>Giving back to the community in various ways – finding fulfillment in more than just the everyday “work.”</p>

<p>Find a mentor or sponsor – getting feedback and honing your skills is the key to continuous (personal) development.</p>

<p>My commitment is to never ask a person where they want to be in 10 years (or 5) again – it locks you in to a plan, and you could miss out on something exciting and unexpected.</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>3/23/2019</strong></p>

<p>Passed the AWS Practitioner Exam after 2 weeks tense study. The questions were not easy at I thought of. Each question was kind of case study. If you had done or did some labs, you should have a correct answer. Some of questions kept asking repeatedly but in different ways. I was confused. I thought I would failed at the end because questions were little tricky. I spent first hour to finish all 65 questions and then I went through all questions again and changed couple of answers. So I used all 90 mins for the exam.</p>

<p>I just bought this book and I am going to read it. This is recommended by the company book club. Also this is about real stories that sounds interested to me! It is a thick book and I hope I will find my time to read it through by the end of March.</p>

<p>2/21/2019 This Chinese book club is not really what I expected. At the end of January, I was expecting people would start talk about the book. However, nothing happened. I didn’t finish reading this book because it is little boring to me. It tells you how to be mindful. It sounds like meditation for me. I don’t really want to do it yet.</p>

<p>Joined a virtual book club at the beginning of this year. This book club will read a book each month and then we will discuss the book online. I ordered the book from Amazon and will read it before the deadline.</p>

<p><strong>Rocky Mountains</strong></p>

<p>8/11/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>Picked this travel book today</p>

<p>8/12/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>Of the hundreds of national parks scattered around the world, Banff, created in 1885, is the 3rd oldest NP. Some countries protect ancient ruins and medieval castles, the Rocky Mountains offer natural wonders. Walking along a well maintained trail is one of life’s great spiritual amusement.</p>

<p>No matter where you travel in the parks, there is a trail nearby that will lead you up spectacular mountains, into picturesque forests or down a dramatic gorge. The Rockies are hikers’ destinations!</p>

<p>8/13/2019 🍅打卡</p>

<p>Trails:</p>

<p>Plain of Six Glaciers + Lake Agnes &amp; the Beehives</p>

<p>Duration: 5 + 4 hours round-trip</p>

<p>Distance: 8.4 + 6.6 miles</p>

<p>Difficulty: Moderate</p>

<p>Start/Finish: Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise</p>

<p>Elevation Change: 1600ft</p>

<p>A classic and popular trail that is ending at a historic teahouse with views across the Victoria and Lefroy Glaciers. It is a jaw-dropper of a hike that’ll leave you breathless in more ways than one.</p>

<p>Follow the paved shoreline walk from the Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise for 1.3 miles to the lake’s end, then head along the edge of the river flats, watching as the glacial creek feeding the lake becomes a torrent. The trail climbs steadily through forest, emerging occasionally to give you views of the glacial ravine. At the 2-mile mark and again at the 2.5-mile mark, you’ll meet trails branching off to the right, leading to the highline trail to the Big Beehive and Lake Agnes. Ignore these and press on up the valley, as the tree cover gradually thins out and you emerge onto switchbacks. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to stop and catch your breath, as well as to gaze at the rapidly approaching glaciers to the southwest and the ice-strewn slopes of Mts Lefroy and Victoria. Keep your ears open for the rumble of avalanches crashing off the distant Victoria Glacier, especially late in the morning. After 2 hours and 3.4 miles of climbing, you’ll reach the Plain of Six Glaciers Teahouse, constructed in 1927 as a way station for Swiss mountaineering guides leading clients up to the summit of Mt Victoria. Nestled in a quiet glade, the twin-level log chalet looks like something out of the pages of Heidi, and dishes up homemade cakes and gourmet teas to a steady stream of puffed-out hikers.</p>

<p>Despite its allure, sensible walkers leave the treats of the teahouse for the return walk, as the main hike isn’t over yet. From the clearing, the trail leads a further 1 mile uphill to the Plain of Six Glaciers itself, tracking a rubbly ridge that can be slippery in wet weather and is exposed to vicious winds funneled up the valley. Although there’s nothing to mark it, you’ll know you’ve reached the lookout when you have a grandstand view of the front edge of the Victoria Glacier and can see back down the valley to Lake Louise and the chateau. Once you’ve admired the views, retrace your steps down the moraine and visit the teahouse before heading back down the valley.</p>

<p>If your legs are up to it, you could detour along the signposted highline trail, which links up with the route to the Big Beehive and Lake Agnes. On the way back to trailhead, you can refuel yourself at the glassy surface of Mirror Lake that famous for its photogenic reflection of the Big Beehive.</p>

<p>Whistlers Summit Trail at Jasper NP</p>

<p>Duration: 3.5 hours one-way
Distance: 4.9 miles
Difficulity: Difficult
Start Trailhead: on Whistlers Rd
Finish Summit: Whistlers Mountain
Elevation Change: 4125ft</p>

<p>If you’rea a peak-bagger, this arduous climb through 3 different life zones to the top of Jasper’s most visited summit – and a handy energy-refueling cafe – could be the lung-bursting wake-up call you’ve been waiting for. While most sane people get the Skytram, there are always one or two masochistic maniacs punishing themselves on this uphill slog.</p>

<p>To get to the trailhead, proceed 1.7 miles down Whistlers Rd to a short, unpaved spur road on the left, which dead-ends in a small parking lot. the hike begins in what is known as the montane life zone of the mountain, consisting of thick forest and healthy aspen growth but, within 1.2 miles, your uphill endeavors will be rewardedd with a rich display of colorful wildflowers. Progressing up toward the treeline, the crippling switchbacks ease momentarily as you pass underneath the midpoint tower of the Jasper Skytram at approximately 5380ft of elevation.</p>

<p>Above the treeline the landscape becomes ever more stony and barren, with eagle-eye views of the Athabasca Valley and Jasper Town unfolding like a satelite map beneath you. For the final 0.9 miles, from the Skytram’s upper terminal to the top,you should have plenty of company, as annoyingly fresh Skytram riders join in for the relatively undemanding dash for the 8088ft summit. The stupendous views of lake-speckled valleys and row after row of endless snowcoated peaks are spellbinding.</p>

<p>This is the book that is required to read in January. Snow was falling outside. I made latte for myself and the white rose is my company while I am reading.</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/52.png" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>It is almost end of January, I just finished reading half of the book. I will continue to read this book in February. Meditation has 3 phases: approach, practice, and integration.</p>

<p><strong>Learn Python in 7 Days</strong></p>

<p><img src="/image/others/Books/53.png" alt="Book" title="Book" /></p>

<p>In January 2019, I finished reading this technical book. This book is for beginners so it wasn’t difficult to understand the concepts. Python just like Java programming but it is <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> less than Java code. Python script is good for cloud computing.</p>

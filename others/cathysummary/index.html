<p>It is almost end of the year again. Time flies and I need to pause here and recall what have I done during year 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Year 2019</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Starting reading books</p>

<ul>
<li>This is becoming a new hobby to me. I met a new friend who introduced me to join a reading club on WeChat. We were supposed to read a book each month. We just need to read 25 mins a day but we need to write down a summary after reading each day. This is really help me to remember what I read. Summary is a big benefit about understanding a book.</li>
<li>Then I also joined company&rsquo;s uRead club. We read a book every quarter and then we meet for 90 mins to discuss it but related with work which is also interesting. However, I feel the discussion is deep for me. I like to attend it and learn sth from colleagues.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Starting writing travel journeys</p>

<ul>
<li>Since my mom needed to go back to China and we didn&rsquo;t know when so we had to keep our vacation for her. It means we can&rsquo;t travel too much this year. So I started to look back my travel pictures and write about my trips and my feelings.</li>
<li>There is also a good opportunity on WeChat. A Chinese group hosted a Travel account on WeChat and they post articles who are interested in travel subject. This encourage me to keep writing sth every week.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Went to China few times</p>

<ul>
<li>I usually don&rsquo;t go to China often because it is a long trip without business seats. However, this year is different. I had to make few trips over there.</li>
<li>At the end of May, went back to my hometown to look for a good senior house to live for my mom.</li>
<li>At the end of October, checked in the senior house with my mom.</li>
<li>At the end of November, carried my mom&rsquo;s clothes luggages back to China.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Starting investment by myself</p>

<ul>
<li>We have a financial advisor but we just met him two times a year and we realized that the commision fee is really high. So we started to think why can&rsquo;t we manage our finance by ourself.</li>
<li>Started reading dummy books</li>
<li>Opened a new trading account for us and plan to invest by ourselves. We go conservative and low commision cost.
<br /></li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Learning new technology - AWS S3 Web Hosting</p>

<ul>
<li>I have had my personal blog for couple of years. I don&rsquo;t have readers but myself. I do it just for fun and keep my memory refreshed.</li>
<li>Cloud is a new technology in Information industry. So I started thinking to build my blog by using AWS S3 bucket from scratch. In this way, I can learn new technology and also get hands-on experiences.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p>Passed the AWS Practitioner Exam</p></li>
</ul>

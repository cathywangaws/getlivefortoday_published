<p>LIVE THE LIFE!
I feel what this mean in Venice. Because of global warming, Venice will be disappears after about 30 years. Each year, the water keeps going up so the city will be under the water after 30 years. Venetian needs to live the life because they won’t know what will happen after 30 years. I also need to live the life because I don’t know how much longer I can enjoy the travel, hiking, seeing the world!</p>

<p>Venice, Italy (<sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>)</p>

<p>Gino’s, Venice Italy</p>

<p>Slovenia
Ljubljana, Slovenia (<sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>)
Slovenia (<sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>)</p>

<p>Split – Home to Diocletian’s Palace</p>

<p>Split, Croatia (<sup>2018</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>)</p>

<p>Among all the people sitting in the cafes, bars and restaurants, wandering and bargaining among the shops and in the markets, promenading on the stone streets, walking along the sea under the palm trees, taking a ship or boat on the sea, it might not be easy to tell who are the tourists and who are the locals because whoever you are, once you are here, you are part of the city.</p>

<p>The heart and soul of Split is the 1700-year-old palace of Diocletian, one of the only four Roman emperors who abdicated. The colonnaded Peristyle, marble streets, palaces within the palace, wonderful arched gates (entrances) and partially excavated sub-structure make Split a museum where people lived and are still living.</p>

<p>The ruins of Diocletian’s Palace, built between the late 3rd and the early 4th centuries A.D., can be found throughout the city. The cathedral was built in the Middle Ages, reusing materials from the ancient mausoleum. Twelfth- and 13th-century Romanesque churches, medieval fortifications, 15th-century Gothic palaces and other palaces in Renaissance and Baroque style make up the rest of the protected area.</p>

<p>戴克里先宫殿建造于公元3世纪末到4世纪初，其废墟在城中随处可见。天主大教堂是中世纪时期在古代陵墓基础上建造的。12至13世纪的罗马式教堂、中世纪防御工事、15世纪的哥特式宫殿以及其他文艺复兴时期和巴洛克风格的宫殿构成了保护内区的其他景点。</p>

<p>Our hotel was only about 20 mins away from this place by walking. It was a very sunny and warm day so it gave us more fun for walking and looking around.</p>

<p>We met a young guy who is a sailer in Split. No doubt that Adriatic Sea is a perfect place for sailing. He told us he lives at here for most of his time.</p>

<p>Split is the second largest city in Croatia and is a very tourist place at Mediterranean Sea. It is also one of the largest passenger harbors on the Mediterranean sea. Split is a stop for Mediterranean cruises. I saw one big ship parked at the harbor. There are also many big boats. At the another side of the sea, there are many private boats too. The whole area feels quiet and calm. Perfect sit in boats with drinking and looking around. They looked so relaxing. They must have good mood under the sunshine everyday! What a life style it is!</p>

<p>We walked along the Adriatic coast and gift booths were lined up on the street.</p>

<p>As soon as we arrived the city center where the area is surrounded by the old buildings. Suddenly a lot of people in this place and this is the place I wanted to visit too. I always like the building with stories.</p>

<p>Today, as a tourist, you can not only witness the glory of the Diocletian Palace 1700 ago but also experience the changes the city has gone through. The Diocletian Palace together with the historic town of Split has stayed in the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1979 not only because of the perfect preservation of the palace but also because of the continuity of life. Walking on the ancient stone roads between the narrow walls, you feel you’ve travelled back in time. The Peristyle, the middle aged Romanesque Church and Gothic Palace, the streets, squares, gates and monuments, each brick and stone have witnessed the change of the city from the old Roman time to the middle ages, and to today.

<p>HAPPINESS IN HAND
Love for Live! Live for Love! All I want is about happiness in my life and I always try to make myself happier than yesterday because I know each day is a valuable day that I shouldn’t waste of it. Live for moment! Live for today! Only present is in my hand and I want to spend the time in my own way. I don’t care how other people do. I have my own way to pursue my happiness! Just like this set of pictures – Happiness in hand!</p>

<p>10/1/2018 &amp; 10/2/2018
Plitvice Lakes NP, Croatia</p>

<p>Guesthouse Sven (hotel name)
Address: Rastovača 8, 53230 Plitvicka jezera, Croatia (Rastovača, 53231, Croatia)</p>

<p>There is no hotels in this area. They call apartments that owned by landlord. Our guesthouse was very close to the park that was about 20 mins by walking. The hostess was friendly and she told us the park information and other things. She gave us the third floor with two bedrooms with full kitchen and living room. The house looks new and clean with pretty landscaping and decent patio furniture.</p>

<p>We had a walk in the park after brought our luggage into the apartment. We went to the big waterfall that is the most popular waterfalls in the park. It was getting dark so we decided to go back to our apartment.</p>

<p>The park opens at 8am so we were there at 7:45 since we wanted to enter the park as early as possible. We wanted walk in the park without crowds! It was a rainy day and the weather was cold too. Howurhese didnot stop our plan. It was our hiking day in the park and we did it. The water is so clear and the color is so blue. There are so many waterfalls in the park.</p>

<p>This wonderful natural phenomenon consists of 16 interconnected lakes and over 90 waterfalls of different size.</p>

Hallstatt, Austria
From Dusk till Dawn – 清晨的哈尔施塔特</p>

<p>Arrived at Hallstatt, Austria after 5pm. The road was on construction so the driving was very slow on freeway. We had to pass Munch city. It is Octoberfest now but I knew there would be tons of people so we didn’t stop by. We wanted to have more time to enjoy nature sceneries.</p>

<p>Once we entered Austria, the beautiful landscape came into our view. We felt it is same beautiful as Switzerland. The hilly landscape with green grass and red roof houses. What a beautiful view that always attract me very much!</p>

<p>We stopped by a very lovely small town. It just have one restaurant, one church, few houses and cows. It is a very peaceful place to get fresh air. We had a stroll around the town and we didn’t even know the name of the town but we enjoyed the atmosphere so much!</p>

<p>Hallstatt has been on my bucket list for couple of years. This small town is a picturesque town or postcard town. It wasn’t easy to visit here by train in Europe since it takes many times. Finally, I got this chance to come over here. The town isn’t big so you probably just need about one hour to stroll the village from one end to another end. However it has something to see and take time to enjoy the place.</p>

<p>When we reached the salt mine place, it was just about closed at 6pm. You could walk up to the top of the mountain but that would take at least one hour and another 45 minutes to come back. We would miss sunset time if we climb up this mountain. So we decided not doing it. We wanted to see the village during sun dusk. We found the perfect place to take postcard pictures and some professional photographers were already there to wait for the lighting. We also stayed at the same place for about one hour to take beautiful pictures from dusk to dark!</p>

<p>The place is so peaceful and tranquil. I really wanted to see it in the early morning again. So we got up at 4:30 next morning and went to the same place at 6:30am. The place was also packed with professional photographers. This time I setup my tripod and started taking pictures just like they did. Sometimes we chatted to others. One guy from Germany and he used two Sony cameras. He used mirrless camera and he told me I should use raw format pictures so I can edit them later. He told us he never take any pictures during day time because sun light is too bright. We talked, laughed, and took pictures.</p>

<p>From Cathy
The beauty of hallstatt, Austria is that there is not much to do other than enjoy…
Take in the beauty, walk the small town,
hike during the day, and dine by the lake in the evening…</p>

<p>From Cathy
Hallstatt is Austria’s oldest town, and one of the oldest towns in all of Europe that is still inhabited. it’s been said that: “before there was Rome, there was hallstatt.” it has a long history due to the salt produced in the mines here.</p>

<p>From Andy
One night stand with Hallstatt，被誉为世界最美小镇的奥地利哈尔施塔特 – 人生需要等候，等候一阵风的拂过，等候一朵花的盛开，或是等候这个黄昏后的邂逅……Life is a dream, make it real!</p>

<p>9/29/2018 Saturday
Frankfurt to Nuremberg, Germany</p>

<p>United global business cabin. This is my first time to sit in the new seat configuration cabin. There are more privacy for each customer other than old seat configuration. The food issame like before.</p>

<p>I had the fish fillet for my main course. I switched to California red blend red wine for dinner. Red is still my favorite wine!</p>

<p>Slept for about 3 hours and then the breakfast light woke me up that was one and half hour before landing.</p>

<p>picked the rental car from Hertz. About two hours distance that took us 4 hours to reach the destination because the road construction. We also had jet leg so we took few breaks.</p>

          <p>Recently I am a fan of Vincent. I like his sunflowers painting and Starry Night paint and gracefully I got opportunities to see the real paintings in person.</p>

<p>Vincent’s paintings were not famous when he was alive.</p>

<p>Always continue walking a lot and loving nature, for this’s the real way to learn to understand art better and better. Painters understand nature and love it, and teach us to see. – Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh (London, 1874)</p>

<p>He draw portrait a lot because he didn’t have enough money to hire a model.</p>

<p>Saw the real Starry Night painting. The color was beautiful. When I stood at front of this painting, I felt I was touched by his stories.</p>

<p>The young Vincent van Gogh spent nearly three years in England between 1873 and 1876. Van Gogh tried careers in the art trade and as a teacher and then a preacher before becoming an artist in 1880, at the age of 27. He died ten years later. So he had only about 10 years for painting and sometimes he could finish a painting in one day. He was poor and got sponsor by his brother. I think that is why he wanted to sell his paintings eagerly but he couldn’t sell them. I could feel his struggling in his short life!</p>

<p>From touchdown to downtown – how to get from Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam city centre
Schiphol airport train station by clint mcmahon</p>

<p>The fourth-largest airport in Europe, Schiphol Airport has won several prizes for the facilities and activities it offers. Before heading to the city centre of Amsterdam, you can pause to admire paintings from Dutch masters at Rijksmuseum Schiphol, see inside a real Fokker plane or start your city break completely relaxed at one of the airport spas – the choice is yours.
Train
Schiphol Train by smlp.co.uk</p>

<p>Taking the train to the city centre is the most convenient travel option, in terms of both comfort and speed. The train journey to central Amsterdam takes only 15 to 20 minutes. The main train operator across the Netherlands is Nederlandse Spoorwegen (NS), which operates trains from Schiphol Airport to Amsterdam Central Station.</p>

<p>Schiphol’s train station is located directly underneath the airport and trains run 24 hours a day. From 06:00 to 00:00 trains depart several times an hour. During the night, from midnight to 12am to 06:00, there’s only one train per hour. If you’d like a more detailed overview of your train journey, you can always check the timetables at the official website of the NS. Please note that Amsterdam Central Station is not the only destination the NS trains run to, as they also head to the outskirts of the city, such as Amsterdam Sloterdijk and Amsterdam Amstel.</p>

<p>A ticket for a one-way journey costs 3.30€ and €7.80 for a same-day return journey (although you’re unlikely to need that one if you’re in town for a few days’ holiday). You can buy train tickets at the yellow ticket machines on the platforms at Schiphol Plaza or at the NS offices near the Meeting Point, which is a large square cube, at the same Plaza.
Trains from Amsterdam-Centraal to Schiphol Airport</p>

<p>Start from Euro 6.69 / person.
Introduction</p>

<p>Famous for its canals, beautiful houses, and ‘coffee shops,’ You feel like you’re walking through a fairy-tale town. Perhaps the most popular reasons people visit Amsterdam is the public use of marijuana and the Red Light District, but the city offers so much more.</p>

<p>Amsterdam is a thriving cultural hub, home to important world-famous museums, historical sites and a lively nightlife district.
Van Gogh Museum</p>

<p>Address: Museumplein 6, 1071 DJ
<a href="https://cathyadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FD67D04D-12C2-4EF5-A7B2-BBA60C459ED5-957x1024.jpeg">https://cathyadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FD67D04D-12C2-4EF5-A7B2-BBA60C459ED5-957x1024.jpeg</a></p>

<p>GET CULTURED AT THE VAN GOGH MUSEUM</p>

<p>In this museum, you will find the largest collection in the world of the works of Van Gogh. It is regularly rated as the top museum in the country and the most visited. You have to purchase tickets before your visit. There are more than 200 paintings on display. This museum is very impressive, even if you know nothing about art, you will appreciate the paintings of Gogh.</p>

<p>Blossoms and falling leaves</p>

<p>Van Gogh was equally fascinated by the changing of the seasons. From Arles, at the awakening of spring in 1888, he wrote his brother:</p>

<pre><code>‘… for Christ’s sake get the paint to me without delay. The season of orchards in blossom is so short, and you know these subjects are among the ones that cheer everyone up.’
</code></pre>

<p>Seeing is more than looking</p>

<p>In order to paint nature well, you must take the time to truly observe everything closely. ‘You have to really look,’ as Hockney says. And, Van Gogh did just that according to him. He could see what many people fail to notice and enchants us with it to this day.</p>

<p>Colour and movement</p>

<p>A landscape full of colour contrasts and wheat stalks swaying in all directions, as though moving in the wind. Hockney closely studied these aspects of Van Gogh’s work. What did he do with his observations?
Rhythm, strokes, dots</p>

<p>Every painter has his own handwriting, as it were. Hockney and Van Gogh, for instance, both use characteristic strokes and dots. And, in painting a forest they choose a vantage point whereby the long lines of the bare trunks dominate.
Two painters, one love</p>

<p>Love of nature, finding yourself, enjoying beauty. For the one this was automatic, for the other something perhaps discovered later. While a profound love of nature came early on for Van Gogh, Hockney needed more time to develop his appreciation of the landscape.</p>

<p>Hockney – Van Gogh</p>

<p>Two Painters, One Love</p>

<p>Nature is in constant motion. David Hockney and Vincent van Gogh both succeeded in capturing this dynamism. How did they do this?</p>

<p>Two painters, one love: Nature. David Hockney (1937) may live more than a century later than Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890), however their vision of landscape is often similar. But what exactly does this nature mean to them? And how did Van Gogh’s landscapes inspire Hockney?</p>

<p>“When [nature] is at its height it looks as though champagne has been poured over the bushes and it is all foaming up and it looks marvelous.”
Fascinated by the seasons</p>

<p>The British painter David Hockney is over 80 years old and still paints every day. Hockney is one of the most renowned artists of our time.</p>

<p>When Hockney lived in the countryside of Bridlington in northern England, he painted many landscapes. Hockney identifies with Van Gogh’s work: both artists see the extraordinary in an unremarkable view. And both are fascinated by the seasons, which bring about continuous change in nature.
Always Sunshine</p>

<p>For twenty-five years Hockney went without seasonal change, as he had experienced in England. All that time he lived in sunny Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Upon returning to his native Yorkshire (2004), it was as though he wanted to make up for that loss: time and again he ventured to a particular place to record the changing of the seasons.
On the Verge of Insanity</p>

<p>How did Vincent van Gogh cope with his illness?</p>

<p>Vincent cut off his left ear on 23 December 1888. It was the first of several serious breakdowns that plagued him until his tragic suicide a year and a half later. We don’t know precisely what his illness was, but it had a huge impact on him.</p>

<p>How did Vincent cope with this difficult period in his life?
A fresh start</p>

<p>Vincent arrived in Arles at the beginning of 1888. He painted intensively in and around the town, inspired by the southern French landscape. As he worked, he dreamed of an artists’ community in his Yellow House. When the painter Paul Gauguin arrived in October, it seemed his dream would finally be fulfilled.</p>

<p>The artists initially worked together happily, but their relationship soon deteriorated.</p>

<p>Their discussions about art sometimes grew heated. Vincent believed it was important to work from reality, while Gauguin preferred to paint from his imagination.</p>

<p>Just before Christmas, they had a furious row, following which a distraught Vincent cut off his left ear.</p>

<p>Vincent ended up in the hospital in Arles, where he was treated by Dr Félix Rey, the assistant physician. Rey believed that Van Gogh was suffering from a form of epilepsy brought on in part by too much coffee and alcohol and too little food. However, he never made an official diagnosis.
Sick in Arles</p>

<p>Vincent gradually came to his senses in the hospital and after two weeks he was allowed to return home. New breakdowns swiftly followed, however, and he was readmitted.</p>

<p>During these attacks, Vincent was totally confused and did not know what he was doing or saying. Between episodes, he did his best to pick up the threads of his life.</p>

<p>Theo was deeply concerned about his brother’s situation. He traveled to Arles the moment he heard from Gauguin that Vincent had wounded himself.</p>

<p>He had to return to Paris after one day at the hospital, but Dr Rey, the postman Joseph Roulin and the Protestant minister Frédéric Salles kept him informed of Vincent’s recovery.</p>

<p>Vincent’s life in Arles did not get any easier when his neighbours organized a petition against him. They were afraid of the painter and wanted him out of the Yellow House.</p>

<p>Vincent was devastated: ‘I have never done anyone harm at any rate, and I am not a danger to anyone’, he told Reverend Salles.
A year in the asylum</p>

<p>Vincent realized in April that he could not risk living alone any more for the time being. A month later, he had himself voluntarily admitted to Saint-Paul-de-Mausole psychiatric hospital in Saint-Rémy. He would eventually spend a year there.</p>

<p>The first period in the asylum went well. Vincent felt good and after a while he was allowed to work outside the asylum.</p>

<p>One day, however, he felt a new attack coming on while he was painting a quarry. It would be followed by further crises.
The final months</p>

<p>The return of his illness made Vincent extremely uncertain and sad, and he lost hope that he would ever recover. He felt trapped at the asylum and wanted to leave as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Vincent left the institution after a year. He moved to Auvers, a village near Paris, to be close to Theo. Dr Gachet, who lived in Auvers, was asked to take care of him. Vincent painted constantly in his final months.</p>

<p>Yet he felt like a broken man and his hope of a full recovery had evaporated. After four months there, he took his own life.
GET DRUNK AT THE HEINEKEN MUSEUM</p>

<p>Address: Stadhouderskade 78, 1072 AE Amsterdam, Netherlands</p>

<p>Hours: 10:30am – 9pm</p>

<p>Fee: Euro 18/person</p>

<p>Born in Amsterdam, raised by the world! For Heineken® fans like yourself, our original brewery in the city centre has been transformed into a sensational interactive tour.</p>

<p>Such a fun way to spend an afternoon. You will learn the history of the company, the recipe, the process behind it all, sample beers, purchase beers, make personalized gifts/ souvenirs, and take lots of photos.</p>

<p>And no, you actually won’t get drunk off the samples (unless you get drunk off two beers, no judgments here), but it’s still 100% worth the trip.</p>

<p>Price: 18-21 Euro per Adult for regular tickets; 55 euro for VIP (includes 5 beers and cheese!)</p>

<p>What is the Heineken Experience?
The Heineken Experience is an attraction located at the Heineken’s first built brewery in Amsterdam’s city centre. In 1988, the brewery was closed due to the inability to meet the high demand. Nowadays, you can learn about Heineken’s® heritage, brewing process, innovations, sponsorships and what it takes to serve a star in a 1.5 hour self-guided tour. At the end of the tour you can, of course, enjoy two Heinekens.</p>

<p>Why is there no VIP tour on Saturday?
As it is the busiest day of the week, we don’t offer VIP tours on Saturday.</p>

<p>Is there a cloakroom?
We do have a cloakroom available in the attraction and it is free of charge. So you can just leave your belongings safe with us and enjoy the tour with your hands free.
WALK THROUGH THE RED LIGHT DISTRICT</p>

<p>Whether you go at day or night, this is a unique experience. You would think it would be uncomfortable or creepy, but it really wasn’t at all, at least for me. Everything is very clean and taken care of.</p>

<p>If you take a walking tour, you will learn a lot about the history. The government has tried to make it a safe place for the woman, free from pimps and abuse. It is regulated, follows rules, and pays taxes. The woman are working for their livelihood so leave your judgements at the door and just experience it for what it is, regardless of whether or not you agree.</p>

<p>RLD is one of the oldest Amsterdam neighbourhoods and architecture observing walks are recommended. Probably the most well known is the beauty of Oude Kerk (old church). But since RLD is in the centre of Amsterdam city, it encompasses many other interesting attractions. For example the Amsterdam dungeon, The Madame Tussauds wax figurines, Body Worlds where human bodies are disected or the Rembrandt House. There is much more. But these are our picks.</p>

<p>As you probably know, the Red Light district fills with people looking for lust and party during the night. For example the Cassa Rosso erotic theatre is well known. But there are many more sex clubs, coffeeshops, pubcrawls and of course ladies that can catch your attention.

<p>Amsterdam Canals Musts</p>

<p>Every canal in Amsterdam is unique and has its own charm. The Gouden Bocht or Golden Curve, the section of Herengracht between Leidsestraat and Vijzelstraat, boasts the most beautiful canal houses in Amsterdam. The bridge on the corner of Reguliersgracht and Herengracht offers an exquisite view. From the odd-numbered side, you can see as many as fifteen bridges! The Magere Brug (’skinny bridge’) is the most picturesque of all bridges. Beautifully lit at night, it is one of Amsterdam’s most romantic spots.

EXPLORE AMSTERDAM’S INDEPENDENT SHOPPING STREETS</p>

<p>There are a lot of shopping options in Amsterdam, but while some go to the popular chain-stores on Kalverstraat, you should head to lesser-known independently owned shops to get your shopping fix. De Negen Straatjes, or more commonly known as ‘The Nine Streets,’ offers both vintage and designer boutiques along the canal. On top of this there are plenty of cozy cafes to grab lunch or a cup of Jo.
TRY A STROOPWAFEL</p>

<p>This popular Dutch food is made from two thin layers of baked dough—like very skinny waffles—stuck together with caramel syrup. You can find these in local stores, food trucks, and bakeries throughout Amsterdam. They come in mini versions or the size of your face. The one featured here is from a Stroopwafel bakery</p>

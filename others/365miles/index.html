有氧无氧是指糖在运动中是无氧代谢还是有氧代谢。有氧代谢一个葡萄糖能产生38个ATP供细胞使用，过程比较慢。走路就是有氧运动。剧烈运动的时候是无氧代谢，快速产生ATP, 副产品就是乳酸
So it means I should do intense exercise, like short distance and full speed running instead of walking for 30 mins.">

<p>I wrote down what I ate for couple of weeks and I think they are pretty healthy food with low carb. However I still have fat belly. I am not sure what is wrong with my diet or exercise until yesterday!</p>

<p>In a new WeChat Tomato Group that are people who had reading a book for 14 days, I found out the root cause.</p>

<p>有氧无氧是指糖在运动中是无氧代谢还是有氧代谢。有氧代谢一个葡萄糖能产生38个ATP供细胞使用，过程比较慢。走路就是有氧运动。剧烈运动的时候是无氧代谢，快速产生ATP, 副产品就是乳酸</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/365Miles/01.jpeg" alt="365 Miles" title="365 Miles" /></p>

<p>So it means I should do intense exercise, like short distance and full speed running instead of walking for 30 mins. The body needs to get sweaty to burn calories!</p>

<p>After a week’s meal plan, Andy lost his weight but I didn’t. Maybe this meal plan works for him but not suited for me! I also need to increase my workout frequency. I didn’t get enough exercise!</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/365Miles/10.jpeg" alt="365 Miles" title="365 Miles" /></p>

<p>A colleague shared this food guideline with me. He went to see a cardiologist specialist and was recommended to follow this diet.</p>

<p>This guideline doesn’t allow to eat fruits but we couldn’t survive. I have to eat some fruits everyday Even though it was considered the sugar items!</p>

<p><img src="/image/others/365Miles/02.jpeg" alt="365 Miles" title="365 Miles" /></p>

<p>5/15/2019</p>

<p>This week, I watched out my food carefully. I tried not eat too much, not much meat either. I had steaks last Friday and Saturday. They are high protein so I didn’t gain weight but I didn’t lose any pounds either. So I combined workout with diet together. So far, I am satisfied my progress.</p>

<p>I had a 2.3 miles walk after dinner for two days. I also did 1 min plank and 40 leg lifting at Monday night.</p>

<p>My left knee was pain after I did jogging last Saturday. It made me different to climb stairs. I don’t know why but it happened recently. However, my left knee is okay when I walk. Probably I should stop jogging for awhile and keep an eye on it. I can’t imagine I couldn’t hiking!!!</p>

<p>4/20/2019</p>

<p>It is April already. What have I done in this year. Where does my time go? I realize I didn’t do enough workout since this year. Now the weather becomes warmer and trees turn to green. I should go out more often to do my exercises.</p>

<p>1/1/2019 Treadmill</p>

<p>I was failed in this goal in year 2018. I didn’t finish 500 miles in 2018. Feel bad about it. So I need a realistic goal – 1 mile per day in 2019.</p>

<p>New year, new resolution – 500 miles in year 2018!</p>

<p><strong>RUN WHILE TRAVELING</strong></p>

<p>Running is good for mind as much as body. Starting a week with a run clears head and leaves happier, more confident, and more positive. Running out is nothing like the drudgery 苦差事 of a treadmill; it’s a way to explore and see places from a new perspective. What has surprised me most is the joy that running can bring me. It isn’t like that every day of course but there are times when everything clicks into place and I can run faster and feel a sense of freedom.</p>

<pre><code>Life is what I make it, find my own path to fulfillment.

I always want to carry myself, my self-esteem 自尊, not depending on others to validate how I look or not letting myself be judged by anything other than my character and intelligence!

A delicious Chinese dish that needs to slow cook for 12 hours and soak in the sauce for another 12 hours to make it sweet and soft. Lotus root has high fiber and other benefits.

We barely meet after I moved to IL. This summer at April 10th, 2019, she came to Chicago for a Microsoft Conference with her boss and we got a chance to hang out together.
We had a walk in the city and took some pictures during the sunset. Then we went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner. It is a famous restaurant in Michigan Ave, Chicago.</description>

Still can’t get together with other friends yet since we all are busy here and there. However our next party will be fondue party. I did some research about food.
4/28/2019 seems another winterstorm day. I was planning out of town but the weather forecast freaked me out. It is better to stay at home to worry free about flights. So I contacted my friends right after work at Friday to gather people together for the Fondue Party.</description>

Today is also the last day for Game of Thrones. We are all fan of it so I got together to cook first and then watch the finale together at my basement.
The ending of Game of Thrones made people upset. However, I think that is what it is. No matter what kind of ending is, people will always not satisfied. For me, I think, the story is not ending yet.</description>

BBQ season begins this year. I found the new recipes for salmon and steak. I also added more vegetables on kebabs so we can eat not only meat but veggies. The longest time is making skewers. I also prefer to use real steel sticks instead of bamboo sticks. Charcoal is really better than gas grill! The flavor is different!

8/4/2019 Sunday
Recently, I like this hand pulled noodle very much. I know noodle has lot of carbs that I shouldn’t eat too much. But this noodle is really a delicious Chinese food and it is a great summer dish.
First, you need to make a dough with all purpose flour, 1% salt, and water.
Then, cut them into smaller pieces and cover them with vegetable oil for about 3 hours.</description>

I think the Chinese mid-autumn festival is around the corner but not sure which day. The moon cake is a dessert cake. I made the moon cake a few times. It is delicious but it takes a lot of time from preparation to finish. I don’t have a plan to make it yet.
My friend made this cake with mung bean and red bean. Edit</description>

Andy and I like adventures. We like to explore new places. We like to try new food. We like new scenic drives. As a world heritage site, Banff National Park offers rugged beauty, unspoiled landscapes and pristine mountain ranges.
Our first visit was at October 15, 2010. At that time, the summer was over and the fall season began. We had to wear our down coats but the scenery was amazing.</description>

Hosted this episode with friends before the summer end. It was a pleasant Saturday afternoon, we made charcoal grilled kebab together.
Actually, I did shopping at Friday and prepared food since Friday evening. I just let them to put chunked lamb on skewers. If I waited them to make food from scratch, it would take hours to finish.
Cooking with Cathy is just for fun.</description>

      <description>Recently I am a fan of Vincent. I like his sunflowers painting and Starry Night paint and gracefully I got opportunities to see the real paintings in person.
London, UK has a special exhibition during 3/27/2019 and 08/11/2019 that is about Van Gogh and Britain at Tate Britain Museum.
Vincent’s paintings were not famous when he was alive.
Always continue walking a lot and loving nature, for this’s the real way to learn to understand art better and better.</description>

      <description>Tower Bridge is a combined bascule and suspension bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894. The bridge crosses the River Thames close to the Tower of London and has become an iconic symbol of London. Because of this, Tower Bridge is sometimes confused with London Bridge, situated some 0.5 mi (0.80 km) upstream.
Tower Bridge Exhibition can take you to the top of the bridge, equipped with a glass floor, as well as to the bottom to the bridge’s engine rooms.</description>

      <description>7/12/2019
I wrote down what I ate for couple of weeks and I think they are pretty healthy food with low carb. However I still have fat belly. I am not sure what is wrong with my diet or exercise until yesterday!
In a new WeChat Tomato Group that are people who had reading a book for 14 days, I found out the root cause.
有氧无氧是指糖在运动中是无氧代谢还是有氧代谢。有氧代谢一个葡萄糖能产生38个ATP供细胞使用，过程比较慢。走路就是有氧运动。剧烈运动的时候是无氧代谢，快速产生ATP, 副产品就是乳酸
So it means I should do intense exercise, like short distance and full speed running instead of walking for 30 mins.</description>

Scotland is one of the most beautiful natural countries around the world. The Scottish Highlands are the home of mountains, glens, and rivers. It is no wonder why they appear as locations in so many movies or TV shows, like Mel Gibson’s self-directed film “Brave Heart”, James Bond’s Skye Fall in “007” movie, “Harry Potter” etc.
There are quite a few ways to get the Highlands, either by train, bus, or car.</description>

      <description>BAREFOOT ADVENTURE – Edinburgh, Scotland
Scotland is an interesting and exciting place to visit. We took a direct flight from Chicago to EDI (Edinburgh International Airport) for my barefoot adventure in July, 2018.
Edinburgh is Scotland’s capital and is not a big city like London and most of attractions are in the medieval old town area, so they are all walking distance. The most interested place is Edinburgh Castle and Royal Miles for us.</description>

      <description>Took a week off even though I was very busy at work. My mom planned to go back to China in April. I had to drop her off at our hometown from Windsor, to Chicago, to Beijing, to Shenyang. It was a long trip and would across three countries, Canada, US, and China.
Andy took the Friday off so he flew to Detroit and rented a SUV from Hertz and then drove to Windsor to pick my mom up.</description>

      <description>Arthritis Patients Respond Very Well to Curcumin Supplements
Arthritis is a common problem in Western countries. There are several different types, most of which involve inflammation in the joints.
Given that curcumin is a potent anti-inflammatory compound, it makes sense that it may help with arthritis. Several studies show this to be true.
In a study in people with rheumatoid arthritis, curcumin was even more effective than an anti-inflammatory drug.Trusted Source</description>

      <description>The Principality of Monaco is about 15km (9.3 miles) from the state border with Italy. The city is a resort for tourists and a tax haven for businesses. It is a small country so you can visit it in few hours because the whole state is not larger than 2 square kilometers which is half size of New York&amp;rsquo;s Central Park. We played by ear in this small charm country at Nov 17, 2017.</description>

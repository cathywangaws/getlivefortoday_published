<p>Garden of the Gods is on my bucket list for couple of years. My original plan was a weekend trip. However, I made this trip in one day. From Denver airport to the garden was only about one and half hour driving. However, the highway is toll. The round trip cost $35 that was same amount for renting a SUV! That surprised me!</p>

The Colorado landscape looks interesting.</p>

<p>What an adventure! I slept for only about 5 hours and Andy probably just slept for 1 hours at Friday night that I felt sorry about him because I had to woke him up! We got up at 3:30am to catch 6:30am flight to Denver, CO in the early morning. We had our breakfast by the airport gate. Bagel with cream cheese that was yummy.</p>

<p>I always like white clouds. Maybe because they can move freely without any obstacles! Coronado is mile high state and the clouds are always the brightest that impressed me so much. What a beautiful Saturday in Coronado. We made it, a day trip to Colorado Springs, CO.</p>

<p>After we landed at DEN airport. We saw these dressed up people to welcome us. It was May the Fourth! I never watched “Star Wars”. These people were celebrating the movie. They are fans!</p>

<p>We parked the car at the visitor center and decided to hike in the park instead of scenic drive. The ranger gave us the great information and she even mapped the loop trail on the map for us. Such a friendly ranger!</p>

<p>We always need to keep our energy for hiking. I felt bad we didn’t hike too much last year and I feel I am gaining my weight now! Summer is coming and I need to keep slim that isn’t easy for me at all because I like food so much. I need to think how I can lose my weight now!!!</p>

<p>Hiking is one of ways. Jogging is another of ways. My problem is I get lazy after dinner recently. I need my routine back!</p>

<p>I saw this guy was taking an orange flower in a paper cup. So I told him it looks so pretty. Then they told us this flower was in the rock and it is dying so they carry it with them and will put it back to a place where the flower can live. What a thoughtful people. Even a small wild flower, they pay a good attention and try to help it out. They have very warm hearts!</p>

<p>Starbucks has a new type of cold coffee that tasted pretty good for a warm day! I ordered this coffee on tap with milk.</p>

<p>Andy had the ice cream when we were waiting for the airplane to go home. I was thinking about my weight so I didn’t buy one for myself:)</p>

<p>The flight was wide open so all standbys got on the business class. It means we would be served a formal dinner with drinks. I rewarded myself with 2 glasses of white wine for dinner.</p>

TRAVEL BEYOND THE ORDINARY!
Had scenic drive along California 1 Highway last weekend and continue to explore California 1 Hwy this weekend. This weekend, the weather is very pleasant about 60 to 70 degrees and clear sunny. So I decided to do a day hiking instead of scenic drive.
After doing little homework, I decided Alamere Falls for hiking. Have seen many waterfalls but this is a tidefall which is rare.">

<p>TRAVEL BEYOND THE ORDINARY!</p>

<p>Had scenic drive along California 1 Highway last weekend and continue  to explore California 1 Hwy this weekend. This weekend, the weather is very pleasant about 60 to 70 degrees and clear sunny. So I decided to do a day hiking instead of scenic drive.</p>

<p>After doing little homework, I decided Alamere Falls for hiking. Have seen many waterfalls but this is a tidefall which is rare. It plummets 40 feet to the Pacific Ocean. It sounded interesting to me so wanted to see it in person. I always like to do a life time experience. Maybe I will just visit this waterfall once in my lifetime!</p>

<p>After finished work at 3:30pm at Friday, I directly took blue line subway to O’Hare airport in order to standby 6:20pm flight. Had BBQ chicken pizza from Wolfgang Puck after TSA. And then went to gate to wait for assign seats for standbys. Got assigned seat tickets after most of revenue customers were on-boarded. So Andy booked a hotel room right away. My weekend started at this moment! I feel relaxed!</p>

<p>At about 6:00pm in Chicago was sunset time. I witnessed the color change when waiting for the departure of the flight. Sunrise and sunset are the best moments in a day. I always like watching the dramatic color changes during these times. It reflects to a life as well. They represent youth and elder! We couldn’t avoid them. That is how a life cycle is! No manpower can change this rule! Therefore, I have to live for today and enjoy every beautiful moment in the world! I know most of people talk about life but I don’t know how they cherish their moment! I just know I have to enjoy my life as much as I can when I still have energy!</p>

<p>Arrived at SFO airport after 4 hours flight. Took the airport train to the rental car facility. Then walked to the Five Start section of Hertz to pick up a rental car. Since the member of Hertz, can skip the counter and get a car directly from parking lot. That is so convenient and easy. Really enjoy this kind of service. I always like booking a full size car because I think it has more room and safer. When travel, drive to mountain areas at most of time so roads are winding and narrow. Full size car is more stable based on my experience.</p>

<p>There were many cars at this section this time. Sometimes, there were few cars. Picked the red Nissan Altima this time. It is a new car that has only been driven about 4000 miles so far. The seats are leather and this car has PlatPass. It means pay toll fees automatically and get charged later from credit card. Golden Gate Bridge has toll but no toll booth so this is perfect for this trip. Just need to pay $4.95 per day to use it. Red is my color of this year!</p>

<p>Next day, got up at 5:45am after about 6 hours sleep, had complimentary breakfast at the hotel. Checked out at 7am. Head to the hiking destination. That took one and half hour drive.</p>

<p>Passed San Francisco city, Golden Gate Bridge, tunnel, some small Villages, beaches etc. The views are beautiful and roads weren’t too busy yet since it was early. When I travel, I always like getting up earlier and start earlier to avoid traffic. Also I like enjoying morning sunlight and fresh air. Morning is best time of a day for me. I get tired and lose focus after late afternoon and I just want to stop my trip and get rest. I am not a night person at all. Maybe this is opposite from most of others. However, I believe most hikers have same schedule like me!</p>

<p>Stopped at a Seven Eleven store. Bought water, energy drinks, sandwich. and chips for lunch since today would be a day hiking.</p>

<p>Arrived at Palomarin Trailhead at 8:40am. The parking lot wasn’t full yet but there were still some hikers over there. This is a very popular hiking trail so no parking space available if you come late.</p>

<p>The Point Reyes National Seashore is a nature preserve. It is a diverse and special place. The landscape is characterized by rolling green hills, rocky cliffs, sandy beaches, and pine forests. There are many hiking trails. Here could easily spend several days hiking. I have only one day. So I need to find a most interested trail for me. After exam the map and read some hiker’s reviews online. I decided to hike Palomarin trail and then walk along the Ocean beach to see the waterfall at the end of my destination. Made the plan. My adventure starts!</p>

<p>My route is: Palomarin trail to coastal trail to Wildcat Campground, to beach to reach Alamere Falls.</p>

<p>This hiking is intermediate skill level and trail type is out-and-back. Total distance is about 11 to 12 miles round trip.</p>

<p>This Saturday the weather was warm and the sky is clear. So the wind clears away the thick fog. You can see the blue Pacific Ocean under your foot.</p>

<p>The exposed dirt trails. Since started earlier, the sun hadn’t risen up too high yet. The temperature wasn’t too hot in the morning. The air was so fresh. All of these natures brought me happiness. I wanted to dance when I walked on trail.</p>

<p>Then passed red wood area.</p>

<p>After couple of miles hiking, arrived Wildcat campground. The view was breathtaking. The wild yellow flowers are blossom in April and blue water was just next to it. What a beautiful view. I was so excited to see them. A such gorgeous campground!</p>

<p>I took off my shoes and walked along the coast. The water was still freezing cold.I had to get out of water after a short walk and then went back to water again. I can’t resist the beauty of nature.</p>

<p>From Wildcat Camp to Alamere Falls is 1.1 mile on Wildcat Beach during a low tide.</p>

<p>The Alamere Falls is freaking awesome. It is right by the Ocean. The falls are a dramatic sight as water cascades over a 30 foot tall cliff onto the south end of Wildcat Beach.</p>

<p>There were some people already at here when arrived at the Falls.</p>

<p>Sit on the beach, had sandwich and apple for the lunch at the Falls.</p>

<p>Saw many people were at the top of the waterfall so I knew that is another way for hiking. However, the path looked so narrow and steep. I got little nervous about it. I was looking at these people and thought if they could do that, I should be able to make it too. So decided to take this route back to trailhead. This area was so challenge and I didn’t think it was safe. I like adventure but I don’t like risk!</p>

<p>However, there is not most difficult part of trail yet. Above the waterfall, there was a creek. It wasn’t too narrow. If you could jump, you can across the creek. I didn’t think I could make a big jump like other people do. I got scared because I was afraid to fall into the cold water. So I decided to walk into the cold water to cross the creek.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, this is just one of two parts of steep areas above the waterfall. Another one is cliff with loose rocks and gravel that you had to climb up to the top to reach the hiking trail.These two areas were crowded because hikers were trying to figure out an easier way! I thought climbing up is easier than going down the trail. Glad I came from Wildcat campground direction! I wouldn’t be able to see the waterfall if I came to this way down.</p>

<p>Totally hiked about 11 miles in 5 hours.</p>

<p>Overall, the trail was flat except  for the last bit, but the length can get challenging.</p>

<p>The trail is known to have poison oaks, hence cover yourself.</p>

<p>Flew the red-eye flight back home.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary day for me. Finished 11 mile hiking and walked on Golden Gate Bridge.</p>

<p>White stones from Pacific Ocean sand beach in CA. They look so pretty. I had to take few back as gifts to myself!</p>

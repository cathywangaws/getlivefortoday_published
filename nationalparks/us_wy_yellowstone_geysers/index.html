<p>Something from another planet – Geysers, Yellowstone National Park!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andy and I landed at Jackson Hole, Wyoming airport at 6pm 8/30/2019. Was planning for this trip for some time now, we were so excited. We have been visited many national parks but Yellowstone is one of my favorites. The park is located mostly in the Northern Wyoming, adjacent to Montana and Idaho states.</p>

<p>Just before landing the view was picturesque. Surrounded by mountains, the airport looked like a small spot in the middle of nature. There are no jet bridges connected to the terminal. As soon as we stepped out the airplane, we breathed the fresh air. The powerful air got us very happy, our dream came true.

<p>Yellowstone is a big and diverse park, such as scenic loops, wild animals, bear country hiking trials, sparkling green-blue lakes, Grand Canyon, endless mountains, etc. However, my main objective was to see geysers, I couldn’t wait longer. Next day, I would fulfill one of my dreams, staring at the geysers, once more at the Yellowstone NP. A blend of color, power, and restless energy that comes out of this beautiful natural phenomenon, something I remembered since our last visit at the Yellowstone. There are hundreds of geysers out there, most of them active.
<img src="/image/NationalParks/US_WY_Yellowstone/Geysers02.jpg" alt="Yellowstone National Park" title="Geysers – Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming US" /></p>

<p>In fact, half of the world’s hot springs are located in the area of Yellowstone. With the amount of continuously flowing sandstone, this place is still considered a zone of the active volcano, meaning that there is a certain degree of danger when visiting this recreation area. However, ignoring all the good-for-nothing worries, we have to see geysers and hot springs again.</p>

<p><strong>Old Faithful Geyser</strong></p>

<p>This is Yellowstone’s most famous underground well, the Old Faithful. You can’t visit Yellowstone NP without seeing Old Faithful. The geyser erupts every 90 minutes and lasts for about 4 minutes. The eruption is enough to create a jet as high as 10 story building or more. The show is gorgeous. The jet stays up in the air and vapors of water disappear blown by the wind.</p>

<p>We and about a hundred others who sited at the geyser-side seats waited for the magic moment. When the underground water started sprayed up, most of people had their phones filming the event. The show got them fulfilled. After the geyser rests, we all smile and comment the show, it was magnificent!
<img src="/image/NationalParks/US_WY_Yellowstone/Geysers03.jpg" alt="Yellowstone National Park" title="Geysers – Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming US" /></p>

<p>Old Faithful Geyser erupts about 17 times a day. I like the way it erupts. In couple of minutes, the steam and heat suddenly comes from the underground and I can feel the power of the eruption that makes my heart beats faster.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Prismatic Spring in Midway Geyser Basin</strong>
<img src="/image/NationalParks/US_WY_Yellowstone/Geysers04.jpg" alt="Yellowstone National Park" title="Geysers – Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming US" /></p>

<p>This is the park’s largest and deepest hot spring. It is a beautiful blend of color, water, and noiseless natural spring. A vast and deep mass of blue water shored by orange yellowish sulfuric rocks. It looks deep in the middle, due to dark blue color.</p>

<p>There are two ways to explore Grand Prismatic. The first is a short hike on the boardwalk that puts you right at the base of the springs. The other is to take the 1.2 mile round trip at the Fairy Falls parking lot to the Grand Prismatic overlook where it is a birds-eye view place.
<img src="/image/NationalParks/US_WY_Yellowstone/Geysers05.jpg" alt="Yellowstone National Park" title="Geysers – Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming US" /></p>

<p>From above, the spring looks like a giant blue eye weeping delicate multi-colored tears. We missed this view last time we were here. It is jaw-dropped view under a clear and warm afternoon.
<img src="/image/NationalParks/US_WY_Yellowstone/Geysers06.jpg" alt="Yellowstone National Park" title="Geysers – Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming US" /></p>

<p>The multicolored mist of the gorgeous pool and its spectacularly colored rainbow rings of algae. It’s hard to believe it’s natural as it looks like someone has painted the colors. It looks unreal, drawn from a fiction comedy book!</p>

<p><strong>Mammoth Hot Springs</strong></p>

<p>The Mammoth Hot Springs is close to the Northern entrance to the NP, about 3 hours away from the Old Faithful geyser. The geyser flows between rocky stairs leaving sulfuric traces with breathtaking colors. The pouring water that travels down between rocks makes a chatty sound witht he mountain beneath. This is the definition of unique in Yellowstone.

<p>It took us about 90 minutes driving from the Park West Entrance. The hike was energetic, early in the morning to be able to see the nature’s non-stop show. We walked on winding boardwalks to admire the graceful limestone pools, ledges, and plateaus. Small cascades of overheated water rush between earth’s wrinkles reminding us of its natural beauty.

<p>I used my special camera lens to capture the details of the springs. The colors are amazing. The terraces and walls provide an otherworldly landscape.
<img src="/image/NationalParks/US_WY_Yellowstone/Geysers09.jpg" alt="Yellowstone National Park" title="Geysers – Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming US" /></p>

<p>The above three geysers/springs are my favorite in the park. They are the masterpieces of the world that impressed me the most. They are unforgettable!</p>

<p><strong>What is a geyser?</strong></p>

<p>There are cracks in Earth’s crust that allow heat and gasses to escape.  There are certain areas where these escaping gasses pool up and meet ground water, thus super-heating them and then releasing pressure by spewing out of the ground.  Hot springs are similar, but tamer; they just kind of sit there.  So, why is this such an interesting phenomena to see?  Watching science happen in front of you isn’t common.  Yellowstone presents a place with more than 60% of the world’s geothermal features and the sight of it is breathtaking.

<p><strong>Morning Glory Pool in Upper Geyser Basin</strong></p>

<p>This pool just looks like a morning glory flower. It displays hundreds of brilliant colors which attracted the attention of everyone to look deep down inside. It requires a hike along boardwalks, but this pool is worth seeing. It is Andy’s one of favorite places.</p>

<p>The ranger said that the water has cooled some because of the debris that has been thrown into it by visitors and this has partially clogged the water vent. Geysers get their color from the water temperature and the minerals in it. Greens and oranges reflect cooler water.

<p><strong>Grotto Geyser in Upper Geyser Basin</strong></p>

<p>Grotto Geyser has weirdly shaped cone, that gives this geyser its name. It is a fountain-type geyser. The cone formed when the spring broke out in the middle of a small grove of trees. The trees may have died earlier from the thermal heat. Trees can only survive when the soil around the roots is cool enough and doesn’t “drink” the silica-rich water. If the temperature of the soil rises too high, the trees will die as the roots cook. They will also die if they drink the thermal water and turns the base of the trunks white while the tops stay dark. The spring at the base of the trees must have had frequent enough eruptions to coat the trunks in silica, bending them over with the weight and heat. One truck must have remained standing that now forms the central vertical column in Grotto’s cone.

<p><strong>Blue Star Spring in Upper Geyser Basin</strong></p>

<p>Blue Star Spring has overflowed for a very long time. It has the thicker overhanging edges around it. The pure blue water attracts me very much. The shape of the spring resembles a star as its name suggests. It is six feet deep and sapphire blue!

<p><strong>Excelsior Geyser in Midway Geyser Basin</strong></p>

<p>The geyser erupted in bursts 50 to 300 feet high. The thermal violence formed the jagged crater and apparently ruptured the geyser’s underground system. It creates the dramatic display shown in this postcard like picture.

<p><strong>Black Opal Spring in Biscuit Basin</strong></p>

<p>Biscuit Basin contains a small collection of thermal features. They are small, gem-like encrusted pools and geysers. This milky color spring looks so calm in a pleasant morning!

<p>Andy and I were immersed in the hands of mother nature, felt the charming changes in this unique park. This wonderful park lets us understand how tiny human beings are in comparison with the vast universe.

<p>Yellowstone has been dubbed “the must-visit place before you die.”</p>

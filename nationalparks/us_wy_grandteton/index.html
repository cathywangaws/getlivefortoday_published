How long haven’t we flied out? Almost two months this summer. Today, we came to the departure lobby in the airport and it looked unfamiliar and we felt we missed it somehow.
This was a busy travel weekend. More and more people took airplanes for traveling. US economy goes very well. We went to economy parking lot G but unfortunately it was full so we had to use our alternative parking lot and then took a cab to the terminal.">

<p><strong>Labor Day Weekend Trip</strong></p>

<p>How long haven’t we flied out? Almost two months this summer. Today, we came to the departure lobby in the airport and it looked unfamiliar and we felt we missed it somehow.</p>

<p>This was a busy travel weekend. More and more people took airplanes for traveling. US economy goes very well. We went to economy parking lot G but unfortunately it was full so we had to use our alternative parking lot and then took a cab to the terminal.</p>

<p>This summer, United Airlines has a seasoning route from ORD to JAC non-stop but the departure time is 4pm which is little earlier for me. However, this long weekend was the opportunity to go. We would visit Grand Teton NP and Yellowstone NP which is just 31 miles apart. Two national parks again.</p>

<p>Jackson Hole, WY is a small town hospitality but a lot of visitors which I don’t like it very much. I feel dizzy when I see many people. I always prefer a quiet and remote vacation.</p>

<p>A national park is an area of land that has been set aside by congress. National parks protect nature and history. Each NP has its own stories. My goal is visiting all national parks in US which it sounds unable to fulfill the goal.</p>

<p>Grand Teton NP – Unusual and beloved natural wonders</p>

<p>We got on one of the first scenic cruise across Jenny Lake to the trailheads on the other side of the lake. Our first trail was Hidden Falls. It was a short hike. The hidden falls is located among mountains. Not many people were there in the early morning so I got an opportunity to sit down and listen the water flows.</p>

<p>We continued for a short uphill hiking to fine views at Inspiration Point. It is at the top of the mountains. The morning was clear. We were able to see the sparkling green-blue water of glacial Jenny Lake. Thousands years ago, large sheets of moving ice called glacier carved the canyons of the Teton Mountains. When the ice melted, lakes were left on the valley floor. Jenny Lake is too cold and too deep for most water plants to grow.</p>

<p>These two hiking trails seemed too short and simple for us. So we decided to continue up our trail in forests. This trail extends to Lake Solitude. Personally, I think the extended trail is more scenery and less crowded.</p>

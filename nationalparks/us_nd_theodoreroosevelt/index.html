It is Labor Day long weekend. I am trying to be out of town. However, many people are traveling during the long weekend. It makes difficult for standby passengers. I had been search so many destinations but they all seemed full flights.
I am going to try Bismark, ND later today. It is a small express flight that has only 50 seats.">

<p>It is Labor Day long weekend. I am trying to be out of town. However, many people are traveling during the long weekend. It makes difficult for standby passengers. I had been search so many destinations but they all seemed full flights.</p>

<p>I am going to try Bismark, ND later today. It is a small express flight that has only 50 seats. Now there are 6 seats open with 4 standbys and we are at 3rd and 4th. Hope we can make it.</p>

<p>We went to the airport very early so we went to a Italian style cafe for a drink at the ORD. The restaurant wasn’t busy but the service was slow. We ordered 2 glasses of Italian wine. The aroma, color, and taste were so so. I still like California wine!</p>

<p>Cafe pictures</p>

<p>We got assigned seat ticket before onboarding time. However, The flight got 40 minuets delayed because the flight crew wasn’t arrived yet.</p>

<p>Each national park was created due to its unique beauty. Every national park has some incredible feature only found there. Bryce Canyon for its hoodoos, Grand Canyon for its enormous canyon with incredible views, the Great Smoky Mountains for its never ending forested mountains. I could go on for each one with an unusual trait that every park is known for. Theodore Roosevelt National Park scenic drives are as good as it gets. Each one has its own jaw dropping scenic drive.</p>

<p>For me, the best part of each national park is the untouched beauty of the trails. The further you explore the more amazing the sights and experiences. So I prefer hiking!</p>

<p>It is about 2-hour drive from BIS airport to South Unit of the park. We had scenic drive first and few short distance trails. The little bend river is the highlight in South Unit. It was a super windy day. The strong wind could blow me away when I was on top of mountains.</p>

<p>In the park we saw open prairie, hardwood draws, bison, other wildlife, and the Little Missouri River.</p>

<p>After the 36-mile Scenic Loop Drive, we stopped by in the town. Each of us has a big ice cream and suddenly, it started raining. The weather changed so quickly but glad we finished scenic drive and ready to drive to Watford, ND for the hotel.</p>

<p>After storms, we saw the rainbow and captured the moment. We also stopped by at a sunflower field but these are big without yellow leaves. Then we saw a farm with dried grass and those rolled Hayes are my favorite. I even sit on top of a big Hayes.</p>

<p>North Unit Visitor Center</p>

<p>Address: 208 Scenic Dr, Watford City, ND 58854</p>

<p>The Northern Unit of this park is much more remote as it is 52 miles off the interstate and 15 miles from Watford City, ND. The 14-mile Theodore Roosevelt North Unit Scenic Byway provides the colorful North Dakota Badlands as a scenic backdrop with its sweeping vistas of one of the last remnants of wilderness in the Northern Great Plains.</p>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt National Park memorializes the 26th President for his enduring contributions to the conservation of our natural resources.</p>

<p>I want to see Cannon Ball Concretions over there. The Cannonball Concretions Pullout is located on the North Unit Scenic Drive near the road leading to the Juniper Campground and Picnic Area. It is also a stop along the way for hikers on the Buckhorn Trail, one of the North Unit’s lengthy loop trails.</p>

<p>I was planning to hike Buckhorn Trail and found Cannon Ball Concretions. We started earlier. We registered at trail head but nobody was on this trail yet.</p>

<p>Buckhorn Loop Trail
Time: 6 – 8 hours / Distance: 12.2 mi</p>

<p>Located near Watford City, North Dakota that features beautiful wild flowers and is rated as difficult. The trail offers a number of activity options and is best used from March until October. You can see a massive herd of bison on the plateau.</p>

<p>Located one mile north of Paddock Creek, Buck Hill is the highest point in the National Park South Unit and a great vantage point to see wild horses or roaming buffalo. It’s a steep trail, but it’s worth every step.</p>

<p>South Unit Visitor Center</p>

<p>Address: Medora, ND 58645</p>

<p>Painted Canyon Visitor Center
Address: 7 miles east on I-94, Medora, ND</p>

<p>Painted Canyon Trail
4 miles
The canyon looks amazing from the rim, but wait until you experience a hike down into it! Get up close and personal with the rock layers, junipers, and wildlife. Remember, every step down means a step back up on the return.</p>

<p>Wind Canyon Trail
20 minutes / 0.4 mi
Enjoy hiking this nature trail alongside a wind-sculpted canyon as you climb to the best view of the Little Missouri River the South Unit has to offer. Another ranger favorite for sunsets!
Enjoy hiking this nature trail alongside a wind-sculpted canyon as you climb to the best views of the Little Missouri River. It’s the Park Ranger’s best kept secret for watching sunsets.</p>

<p>Cannon Ball Concretions</p>

<p>The large spherical boulders in front of you are called concretions. They may have any shape, but most are round. Concretions are formed within rocks by the deposition of mineral around a core. More concretions will be exposed here as erosion continues.</p>

<p>Prairie Dogs</p>

<p>Black-tailed prairie dogs originally named “petits chiens,” or “little dogs,” by early French explorers, these highly social animals are not really dogs, but rodents.</p>

<p>Tthe black-tailed prairie dog inhabits Theodore Roosevelt National Park.
Named for their bark-like calls and black-tipped tail, black-tailed prairie dogs are small, short-tailed animals with eyes and small ears set far back on their heads. Their light-brown fur blends well with the dirt of their mounds except when the animal has been blackened by burrowing into coal seams. Prairie dogs average 14 to 17 inches in length and weigh 1 to 3 pounds. With short, muscular legs and long-nailed toes on their front and hind feet, they are well equipped for a burrowing lifestyle.</p>

<p>A prairie dog “town” consists of a large number of closely spaced burrows, each comprising an elaborate network of tunnels and multiple entrance holes that provide escape routes from pursuing predators. The primary prairie dog social unit is the “coterie,” an acre or so of territory with 50 to 60 burrow entrances that is occupied by a single family group. A coterie typically consists of one adult male, several adult females, and their offspring. Members of a coterie are a closely knit group, recognizing each other by an identifying kiss or sniff. Their cohesiveness is maintained by the cooperative activities of raising young, constructing burrows, grooming, playing, and defending the coterie territory. The dominant male is typically the most active in the defense of the coterie, patrolling its invisible borders and challenging all comers. Prairie dogs warn of territorial trespassers from adjacent coteries or approaching danger by emitting a series of “barks,” which sound more like high-pitched squeaks. Specific threats are associated with distinctive vocalization patterns that serve to alert all residents of a town to the common threat.</p>

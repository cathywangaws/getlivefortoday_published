<p>At the same day seven years ago, Andy and I visited the park and first time saw bison in person. We were so excited but with little nervous. People jumped out of their cars to get closer look at a herd of bison. However, there were rangers with us. So we felt much safer!

<p>Hayden Valley, Yellowstone NP with its broad expense of grasses, has been a home to bison for thousands of years. They are protected by rangers and hunting is not allowed in the park. They stand as an imposing icon of American conservation.</p>

<p>At Sept 1, 2019, we saw a herd of bison again. It was about noon under a clear blue sky, those bison were taking a nap. I got encouraged to run into them but I was still far away. I didn’t want to wake them up eventually!</p>

<p>Bison are born, live and die here. Though wolves prey upon Hayden Valley bison, their great enemy is weather. Only strongest, furriest, and fattest bison can survive a bitter Hayden winter.

<p>Rhythms of Life</p>

<p>Instinct guides them every year to decide whether to stay in the valley or migrate to lower elevations in search of food. However, they will come back home to Hayden in spring to begin the cycle anew. Human needs a home to stay so does bison!

<p>Shake, Wallow, Roll</p>

<p>Look for clouds of dust rising in the air. Bison wallow in dusty pits to dislodge biting flies and other insects from their fur. Big bulls might paw the dirt and horn the wallows in displays of aggression. When I was taking photos, I witnessed one bison did the exact same thing in the grassy land.

<p>An accessible safari</p>

<p>We stayed at Yellowstone Lake Hotel at year 2012. As soon as we stepped out the hotel lobby in the early morning, we saw a herd of bison near by the Yellowstone Lake. Suddenly we felt we were at an accessible safari. We were so close with them. We could hear their heavy breath. We quietly captured this unbelievable moment in our lifetime.

<p>There was a ranger at Hayden Valley to tell stories about bison. Bison is the largest land mammal in America, bison can weigh up to 2,000 pounds. Males are bigger and heavier than females. How do you tell them apart? Male bison (called “bulls”) have a triangular shaped head and a furrier beard than their female counterparts. Bison are not same as buffalo, bison can live in cold places, while buffalo prefer warmth.

You might think bison are slow because of their size and lumbering gait. Not so. Bison can run up to 35 miles per hour, solo or in a herd. However, they are relatively calm, unless frightened.</p>

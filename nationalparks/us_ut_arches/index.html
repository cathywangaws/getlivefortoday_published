We made a big mistake on our very first visit to Arches National Park: we visited on a sunny noon in July, when the temperature was pushing 100+ degrees Fahrenheit. However, we were smarter this time. We arrived at the park around 3pm at February 28, 2020 and directly headed to the Delicate Arch trailhead since we didn’t want to start the hiking too late and miss the sunset.

Delicate Arch is one of the most famous arch formations in the country. The Arch is on Utah license plates. It is the largest free-standing and magnificently alone in the natural sandstone bowl in the park.

We were sitting at the edge of the surrounding cliffs looking over the Delicate Arch. We felt like we were in an ancient Roman amphitheater.
It’s quite amazing to see how these arches are formed and to contemplate the power of water and ice, extreme temperatures and underground salt movement – all of which are responsible for the diverse and unique rock scenery of Arches NP. We decided to hike the Devils Garden trail to see more arches next day.

Long, thin Landscape Arch stands in Devils Garden. This is the longest arch in North America. It is constantly changing. In 1991, a large slab of rock fell from Landscape Arch leaving behind a thinner arch and a bunch of scared people who heard the rumbling and thought it was a nearby thunderstorm. Lucky no one was hurt when it fell.

Double O Arch is difficult to reach as it steeply climbs up and on the sandstone fins. Sometimes, I had to use hands and feet to scramble and climb. Having two arches on top of one another which is pretty cool. Even though it may not seem very big, it is actually quite large, as I could easily stand on top of the lower arch.

The Dark Angel formation is a 150-foot sandstone column rising improbably from the desert floor. It stands isolated and desolate, away from other rock formations.

What a view at Partition Arch. We enjoyed the view of Arches National Park and the landscape of Devils Garden through “the window”.

A teetering giant Balanced Rock which is one of the most iconic features in the park.

The Windows section of Arches is a must-see. The sunlight is best in the late afternoon hours, making the Windows a solid choice for sunset.

This red rock landscape made us feel timeless or dream-like. There are 2000 natural stone arches have documented in the park. It was a great choice to hide in the mountains. There is no 5G network in the mountains, not even 1G network signals, it is rare to not touch the overwhelming self-media all day…</p>

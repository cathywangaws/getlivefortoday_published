          <p>Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, US encompasses mountains, forests, and alpine tundra. Andy and I visited this park a few times before. This time we just wanted to see tundra.</p>

<p><img src="/image/NationalParks/US_CO_RockyMountain/Tundra01.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park, CO US" title="Tundra – Rocky Mountain NP, Colorado US" /></p>

<p>The word tundra means a land without trees. Tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, Alpine tundra, and Antarctica tundra. Rocky Mountains have alpine tundra. The alpine tundra ecosystem starts at elevations of 11,000 feet. This is truly a land of extremes. Strong, frequent winds and cold temperatures help limit what plants can grow there. I tried to use my imagination to think what tundra looks like on the peak of mountains and how strong the wind would be. I finally came to meet my curiosity!</p>

<p>Andy and I flew to Denver, CO airport where it is about 2 hours driving distance to the park entrance. We arrived at Beaver Meadows Visitor Center at 8:30am, June 29, 2019. Tundra lives at the high elevation area so we had to drive on the Trail Ridge Road where the elevation is 12,000 feet. This road is a popular scenic drive with many viewpoints. People stepped out of their cars and enjoyed atmosphere. We enjoyed the winding and narrow uphill road in our car. One side of the road is sharp mountain edge and another side is snow walls. The sky is clear and blue with floating white clouds. After 30 minutes non-stop driving, we arrived at Alpine Visitor Center where is the highest point of the park. This area was still covered by a lot of snow.</p>

<p><img src="/image/NationalParks/US_CO_RockyMountain/Tundra03.jpg" alt="Rocky Mountain National Park, CO US" title="Tundra – Rocky Mountain NP, Colorado US" /></p>

<p>We went to Milner Pass trail where it is on Trail Ridge Road at the Continental Divide west of the Alpine Visitor Center. It is a 4.1 miles trail but only opened about first half mile because the deep snow blocked the trail and it was dangerous to pass through. This trail is one of tundra hikes in Rocky Mountain NP. Tundra is covered with dense turfs and grasses. The rich soils of the tundra also support a variety of wildflowers, but you would see them when the weather became warmer and snow got melt. I felt like I was on another planet. The cold and thin air brought me excitement. I started to jump and open my arms to embrace the nature and let the wind softly blows on my face. I instantly fell in love with the Alpine Tundra.</p>

<p>What is the Continental Divide? It is the line that divides the flow of water and snow melt. On the East side of the Continental Divide all the water flows to the Gulf of Mexico and the West side of the Continental Divide flows to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>The alpine tundra of Rocky Mountain NP is vast, covering nearly a third of the park. Though there is tundra in other US national parks, none is as readily accessible as this, offering a rare opportunity to observe and enjoy a wondrous community of highly specialized species.</p>

<p>After we went back to the parking lot, we saw another trail that was just opened up for visitors – Marmot Trail. This trail wasn’t on my list so I didn’t have any information handy. However, it was a sunny morning and we saw other hikers as well. So we guess it might be a popular trail on the top of rocky mountains. At the beginning, snow was on both side of the trail and people walked on the dirt path. Then we saw a pond that was formed by melted snow with tundra surroundings. On the way to the peak, we met other people. They kept telling us, “You are almost there and it is worth the effort.” However, we still had no idea where the trail ends!</p>

<p>I was soaked in the beautiful scenery.  The open air made me felt so calm. The clear sky made me felt so happy. In this moment, I could forget all unhappiness and just enjoyed the mother nature that brought me in peaceful mind. I was so relaxing on both physical and spiritual.</p>

<p>The elevation gained fast so we took breaks and drank water more often. We saw one marmot animal and few elks on this trail too. They were not scared of people at all. They looked like they were at home and we were at their backyards.</p>

<p>We were no longer keep track of the time. We saw alpines under our feet. We saw other mountains across us. I closed my eyes to let the atmosphere hug me. It was the moment that I would never forget! I felt so connected to nature, so live!

We stopped by at the ranger station after couple of hours hiking and wrote down our experiences.

This is the Land of Harshness and Beauty. I was so glad that we made it and my spirit got soar.</p>

<p>Alpine Tundra, see you next time!</p>

<hr />

<p>The first half of the year is over. I made the trip to Rocky Mountains in the last weekend of the first half year! From hub to hub that is not easy for standbys. We may get stuck at the hub and buy tickets back. When I looked the flight status, the routes to Denver hub seemed to have chances. So I decided to give it a try and worse case is stay there one more night and buy tickets back. However, we didn’t get on the 6pm flight at ORD. We waited for the 9pm flight and had drink at Goose Island bar in terminal 1.

<p>The flight was little delayed but we got on! We took rental car shuttle bus to Hertz at about 11pm. The facility looked empty because most parking spots were empty already. It looked like all cars were rented out. We went to the office to request a car and they told us to pick a car at Residential Club area. We found a brand new SUV which has only 165 miles. That is a good deal!

<p>We arrived the hotel at 12 midnight and it is about 2 hours drive to Rocky Mountains National Park. Usually, the peak of Mountains’ weather changes quickly. First minute could be sunny but next minute could be thunderstorms. As a hiker, always start hiking earlier in morning and finish up in early afternoon. So we have to get up at 5:30am, have breakfast at 6am, and head to the park before 7am. It was a sunny morning and the traffic was light.

<p>&ldquo;Alpine weather</p>

<p>bounces between sunlight and storms,</p>

<p>strong winds and balmy breezes,</p>

<p>violent weather and surprising calm&hellip;</p>

<p>resilient plants, insects, birds, and mammals</p>

<p>flourish in harmony with the land&rdquo;</p>

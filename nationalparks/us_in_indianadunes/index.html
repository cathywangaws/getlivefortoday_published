Didn’t travel a lot this year since the work kept me crazy busy. Last weekend, I was able to relax in town so our Chinese group went to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore for a picnic. The weather was about 80F degrees. At the same day, Chicago had Air and Water Show so I thought there weren’t too much people on the beach. As soon as I entered the dunes area, I saw tons of people over there.">

<p>Didn’t travel a lot this year since the work kept me crazy busy. Last weekend, I was able to relax in town so our Chinese group went to Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore for a picnic. The weather was about 80F degrees. At the same day, Chicago had Air and Water Show so I thought there weren’t too much people on the beach. As soon as I entered the dunes area, I saw tons of people over there. It is a small beach, not like beaches in West Coast or East Coast.</p>

<p>Wet land area. The dune isn’t very pretty because there are many plants.</p>

<p>I have known my friends for years in Chicago but we never had outing event like this before. We usually have dinner parties at one of our homes. Everyone was cooperate for the picnic. There is no alcohol allowed at public beach so I bought ginger beer from Costco. Ying brought cold expresso coffee and water. We all brought food.</p>

<p>Andy made Chinese pancake with green onions. It is very delicious.</p>

<p>I cut the watermelon in round shape to make them look fancier.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Seasonal Lee Chi fruit</p>

<p>I also grilled pork ribs. It turned out dry because I didn’t want to add BBQ sauce.</p>

<p>We watched people playing in the water when we were eating. The wave was big so people couldn’t go too deep of the water. When we entered the park, the park person told us “knee deep restriction”. It wouldn’t be safe if you want to far in the water because of big waves.</p>

<p>We brought two digital cameras. Pete has Sony and we have Nikon. Sony is more computerized camera. It means it takes time to process of each picture so you couldn’t take the next picture until the process is completed. It has a small idel time. However, I like Nikon better because I can keep shooting many pictures so quickly. Taking a good picture means capture the special moment. If I can take 100 photos in a short period of time, it should have one or two outstanding pictures. Digital is much productive than film.</p>

<p>The sky wasn’t very blue and had thick clouds blocked the sun. The water was little gray with big wave. So it needs technique for photo shooting. Pete is good at using manual mode so he could adjust some numbers on the camera to make the wave more brighter and the background more blurry. I got some great pictures.</p>

<p>We stayed over there for about 3 hours. We took enough photos. So we felt it was little boring and hot by just sitting on the beach. We decided to come back to my backyard for cold beers and exchange our pictures.</p>

<p>It was a relaxing summer day. This outing was successful!</p>

Red Bean Bread, An Asian Bakery Favorite
The holy grail. The originator. The classic. The veteran.
Okay, maybe I’m overstating, but something about the red bean bun inspires respect. It’s the old guard. The faithful standby when you don’t want some weirdo questionable scallion, ham, cheese concoction, or you’re just about fed up with dribbling pineapple crumb topping all over your shirt as you walk down the street.">

<p>Red Bean Bread, An Asian Bakery Favorite</p>

<p>The holy grail. The originator. The classic. The veteran.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe I’m overstating, but something about the red bean bun inspires respect. It’s the old guard. The faithful standby when you don’t want some weirdo questionable scallion, ham, cheese concoction, or you’re just about fed up with dribbling pineapple crumb topping all over your shirt as you walk down the street.</p>

<p>And then, there’s also those impossibly pillowy soft milk bread loaves that are injected with magical swirls of delicious red bean goodness. It’s like the Chinese equivalent of cinnamon swirl bread; eating a slice feels like a delectable junk food special occasion.</p>

<p>So now we give you the moment you’ve all been waiting for. We FINALLY have a red bean bread recipe for you guys—a bun version AND a swirl loaf. We’ve tackled a lot of other Chinese bakery buns, but this was definitely one of the tougher ones to master.</p>

<p>When a lot of you think of red bean paste, you’re probably conjuring images of dark red sticky sweet paste that you might find in a fried sesame ball or see on grocery store shelves in plastic sachets. This is NOT easy to achieve at home. Why? Well red beans actually cook up to more of a purple than red color. So unless you want to add some good old red 40, you’re out of luck there. What’s more, we’ve found that disturbing amounts of sugar and fat are required to get a paste that even REMOTELY resembles those store-bought, mass produced red bean pastes. That said, we decided to go with a more natural red bean paste. It’s just as good, more natural tasting, healthier, and the flavor of the red bean really shines through.</p>

<p>Okay, so now for some real talk. To the casual observer, this recipe sounds straight up complicated. Truthfully though, it’s just a time commitment. The actual steps are not that difficult. You just need a decent chunk of time and a relaxing Sunday to make this recipe right. If you want to make things easier, the red bean paste can be made in advance. Just heat it in a pot until it’s just warmed through. But I think that we’re all ready for red bean bun and red bean swirl bread mastery, so let’s get started!</p>

<p>For the red bean paste, you’ll need:</p>

<pre><code>8 ounces dried adzuki beans
¾ cup sugar
6 tablespoons butter
</code></pre>

<p>Start by washing and rinsing the red beans prior to soaking. Soak the red beans overnight. When you’re ready to start cooking the paste, pour the red beans and water into a medium-sized pot. Ensure that the water level is about ¼” above the red beans. Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat to simmer. Cook the beans until completely softened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>

<p>Since we are making a paste, you don’t want a lot of liquid in the beans. Most of the water should be cooked off and the beans should be very thick before you move forward. Be careful, because as more water cooks off, burning the beans is very easy to do. This whole process will take a few hours.</p>

<p>When the beans have a thick consistency, transfer to a food processor. Depending on the size of yours, you may need to process the bean mixture in batches. Process until the mixture is totally smooth. If you like your red bean paste chunky, skip this step or process to desired consistency.</p>

<p>Transfer the red bean paste back to the pot. Heat the paste over medium-low heat. Add the sugar and stir to dissolve. Then add the butter. More butter means a richer paste. You can also use vegetable oil at this step, but butter adds a more pleasant flavor. Cook for an additional 15-20 minutes to cook off even more moisture from the paste.</p>

<p>Quick disclaimer here: It won’t look like the packaged red bean paste you get at the store because those pastes have enormous amounts of sugar and oil added to make them sticky and dark. We’re going for a more natural Chinese bakery red bean paste here. If you like the store-bought red bean paste, feel free to take a shortcut and use that!</p>

<p>Set aside and let cool for an hour or so before using. Do not refrigerate!</p>

<p>The sweetness of the oranges, the earthy beets, the creamy, satiating avocado chunks, and crunch of toasted hazelnuts come together to create one impressive beet salad.</p>

<p>Step 1: Cut the peeled beets into quarters, and toss in a bowl with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil, sherry vinegar, and orange juice.
Step 2: Spoon the beets on a large platter and drizzle on any remaining dressing. Add the avocado slices, and season with salt and pepper. Top with orange segments, hazelnuts, and a small handful of micro greens.
Step 3: Lightly drizzle with olive oil and serve immediately.
Cubed beets, Walnuts, Green Leaves, and red onion</p>

<p>Steaming vegetables is a healthy way to cook vegetables. It requires no additional fats and the steaming process helps the vegetable itself to retain more nutrients and flavor.</p>

<p>Steam cubed beets that will takes about 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

<p>We plant some basil in pots at our backyard. Basil is easy to grow so we always have basil leaves during the summer. I mad basil salad dressing. It is very good.</p>

<p>Salad is becoming a very popular dish because people think they are healthy. It is considered as diet food. I want to maintain my body shape so I have to follow this trendy to eat more salad.</p>

<p>I think if a salad is light and healthy food or not based on the salad dressing. If a dressing is too rich, no matter how much leaves in your salad, it won’t be a healthy and low calories dish.</p>

<p>I have been using Olive Oil, Salt, and Pepper for my salad for awhile and now I am tired of this dressing. I am ready to try sth new now. I am also ready for new kind of salad.</p>

<p>kale, carrot, tomato, olive, and mixed nuts with honey mustard dressing! Pepper jack cheese on top!</p>

<p>After I checked Avocado nutrition, I should reduce eating it. One avocado has 322 calories and 44% is fat. The good thing is it has 52% fiber and Vitamin C is 33%, and Vitamin B-6 is 25%.</p>

<p><strong><em>Fish Maw Soup</em></strong>
Made this soup with canned sweet corn, fish maw, and egg white.</p>

<p>Fish maw is a good source of collagen, which is vital in healthy skin beauty in all age group of either gender.</p>

<p>So I bought 2 different kinds of fish maw from Chinatown and wanted to give them a try.</p>

<p>What is fish maw?</p>

<p>Fish maw is the commercial term for the dried swim bladders of large fish.</p>

<p>It has no fishy taste and absorbs the flavor of other ingredients it is cooked with.
For the Chinese, it is considered one of the big four precious traditional delicacies of the sea: abalone, sea cucumber, shark fin and fish maw. I had tried all these four traditional food.</p>

<p>This kind of fish maw is used for soup. It just needs to sock in the cold water for couple of hours.</p>

<p>Many Chinese people believe that drinking fish maw soup and eating fish maw will improve their skin beauty and, for pregnant women, the skin of their babies. Furthermore, fish maw does not contain cholesterol. It therefore is a premium health enhancing ingredient suitable for long time consumption.</p>

<p>I know it won’t have any changes in a short time. I just hope my skin still looks good after years.</p>

<p>I made this kind of fish maw soup at home too. It turned out very delicious. I added scallops as well.</p>

<p>How to prepare fish maw before cooking?</p>

<p>Fish maw require pre-soaking before cooking. The soaking time will vary depending on the type of fish maw.</p>

<p>Premium fish maw :
– Soak fish maw in water for 12-18 hours until it soften.
– Change water from time to time and rinse with cool water to eliminate its fishy smell.
– Put ginger into a pot of fresh water and boil. Turn off the heat after the water is boiled.
– Put the soaked fish maw and cooking wine into the pot and tightly covered with the lid. Wait until the water cools down.
– Take out the fish maw and rinse with clean water then it is now ready for cooking.
– Soaked fish maw should be stored in the refrigerator at below 0℃ if not cooked. Thaw each time before serving.</p>

Recently, I like this hand pulled noodle very much. I know noodle has lot of carbs that I shouldn’t eat too much. But this noodle is really a delicious Chinese food and it is a great summer dish.
First, you need to make a dough with all purpose flour, 1% salt, and water.
Then, cut them into smaller pieces and cover them with vegetable oil for about 3 hours.">

<p>Recently, I like this hand pulled noodle very much. I know noodle has lot of carbs that I shouldn’t eat too much. But this noodle is really a delicious Chinese food and it is a great summer dish.</p>

<p>First, you need to make a dough with all purpose flour, 1% salt, and water.</p>

<p>Then, cut them into smaller pieces and cover them with vegetable oil for about 3 hours.</p>

<p>Then, hand pull each piece of dough.</p>

<p>Finally, put them into boiled water to cook for about 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Andy made braised pork belly and we had them with noodle. It is the best noodle dish so far.
noodle with braised pork belly. So delicious.</p>

<p>Hand-pulled noodle that I learned from a restaurant in New York City. Manhattan, New York has so many Chinese restaurants. We found this XiAn style noodle place in NYC. It is spicy food but it is so delicious so I decided to make it by myself. I watched a few videos on YouTube and found out it is not difficult at all.
Spicy noodle with cooked vegetables</p>

<p>We came from North of China so we like carb food very much. It is hard to resist this kind of food when we see them no matter where we are!
It is called Liang Pi</p>

<p>The owner of this noodle place is a young Chinese guy and now his restaurant is located at couple of different locations in NYC so more people can eat it.</p>

<p>Also his business was published on Time Out magazine.</p>

<p>No matter what you do, if you do it right and lucky, you will get success!</p>

<pre><code>Customers are already waiting for lunch before it is opened.

<p>I start from making chili oil. When I eat, I try to avoid processed food and always try to make them from scratch. So I would know what ingredients are and how healthy they will be.</p>

<p>Wash dried red peppers. Low heat to make them dry and color is little dark but don’t burn them.</p>

<p>Grind all peppers
Add cooked vegetable oil</p>

<p>Cold noodle with cucumber and bail leaves.</p>

<p>Make a dough with cold water and salt.</p>

<p>Cut to smaller pieces and spread little bit vegetable oil on them. Put them into fridge for at lease 2 hours.</p>

<p>Make noodle by hand. Boil them for couple of minutes until they float on the top of the water.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to add little dark vinegar when you eat them. Enjoy!</p>
